# Abstract

Nowadays the price of fuel per liter varies widely from gas station to an other. In fact, once the most convenient station is found, drivers no longer tend to change it, even if the price become no more convenient. 

A team of software developers has come up with a way to facilitate the search for the nearest and most convenient gas station. 
EZGas was born from this idea, in fact it is a crowdsourcing service that allows drivers to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and locate them in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name           | Description | 
| -------------------------- |:-----------:|
| Driver 	                 |He/She uses the application to locate nearest gas stations and to insert or update gas price information| 
| Gas Stations Managers      |They are interested in being always up to date to the price of competitors in the same area| 
| EZGas Developers			 |They are responsible for any issue and have to monitor user experience to prevent problems and improve the system|
