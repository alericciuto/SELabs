1
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:43,916
Excuse me.

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,627
I was looking for the <i>Weekly Volcano</i> office.

3
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,337
I wish to see Mr. Dashwood.

4
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,927
A friend of mine desired me to offer a story by her.

5
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:57,054
She-- She wrote it.

6
00:01:57,138 --> 00:02:00,933
-She'd be glad to write more if this suits.
-Not a first attempt, I take it.

7
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,728
No, sir. She has sold to <i>Olympic</i> and Scandal,

8
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,023
and got a prize for a tale at the <i>Blarneystone Banner.</i>

9
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,483
A prize?

10
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:10,902
Yes.

11
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,030
Sit.

12
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,490
We'll take this.

13
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,535
Oh, you will?

14
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,662
With alterations. It's too long.

15
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,082
But you've cut...

16
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,253
I took care to have a few of my sinners repent.

17
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,255
The country just went through a war.

18
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:15,716
People want to be amused, not preached at.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Morals don't sell nowadays.

20
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,221
Perhaps mention that to your friend.

21
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:26,310
What compensation--? How do you--?

22
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,896
We pay 25 to 30 for things of this sort.

23
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,523
We'll pay 20 for that.

24
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,279
You can have it. Make the edits.

25
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:48,958
Should I tell my friend that you'll take another
if she had one better than this?

26
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,794
We'll look at it. Tell her to make it short and spicy.

27
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,424
And if the main character's a girl,
make sure she's married by the end.

28
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,593
-Or dead. Either way.
-Excuse me?

29
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:02,263
What name would she like put to the story?

30
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:06,225
Yes, none at all, if you please.

31
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,060
Just as she likes, of course.

32
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,228
Oh, well...

33
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,899
Good morning, sir. Good day.

34
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,318
Yes!

35
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,233
My Beth would like you very much.

36
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:58,986
-I'd like a room for two people.
-Perfect. That's 4.50 a week.

37
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,406
-And that's a good price.
-Isn't that a little expensive?

38
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,826
This is a boardinghouse, not a charity.

39
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,661
I need the rent on time.

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,877
Good afternoon, Miss March.

41
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,295
Oh, good afternoon.

42
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,555
You're on fire.

43
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,472
Thank you.

44
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,269
You're on fire!

45
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:37,650
-Thank you.
-I have the same habit. You see?

46
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,947
Kitty and Minnie are waiting.

47
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,200
-My students need me.
-Always working.

48
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:49,871
Money is the end and aim of my mercenary existence.

49
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:53,958
No one gets ink stains like yours
just out of a desire for money.

50
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,837
My sister Amy's in Paris,
and until she marries someone wealthy,

51
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,047
it's up to me to keep the family afloat.

52
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:01,215
Goodbye.

53
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:26,032
The Decadents have ruined Paris, if you ask me.

54
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:29,785
These French women couldn't lift a hairbrush.

55
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:30,995
Amy!

56
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:34,373
I said, these French women couldn't lift a hairbrush.

57
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:37,001
Oh, yes. Very true, Aunt March.

58
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,961
Don't humor me, girl.

59
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:43,591
What do they write, your troublemaking family?

60
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,010
Mother doesn't say anything about Beth.

61
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:51,516
-I feel I should go back, but they all say, "Stay."
-You can do nothing if you go back.

62
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,518
The girl is sick, not lonely.

63
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:58,481
And you shouldn't go home until you
and Fred Vaughn are properly engaged.

64
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:02,109
Yes, and until I've completed all of my painting lessons.

65
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:05,780
Oh, yes, yes.

66
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:08,241
Of course.

67
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,875
-Stop the carriage! Laurie!
-What are you doing?

68
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,086
-Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!
-Amy!

69
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,420
-Laurie!
-Amy!

70
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:22,922
Amy!

71
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,007
How are you?

72
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:28,636
-You've grown so much.
-You wrote you'd meet me at the hotel.

73
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,888
-I couldn't find you.
-You didn't look hard enough.

74
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:33,516
-I didn't recognize you. You're so beautiful now.
-Stop it.

75
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,601
-I thought you liked that?
-Where's your grandfather?

76
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:38,980
In Germany. He's still traveling.
I'm traveling on my own now. Just relaxing.

77
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,941
-Flirting and gambling and drinking.
-Yes. Don't tell your mother.

78
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:44,026
Are you chasing some young girl across Europe?

79
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:45,736
No.

80
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:51,200
I couldn't believe Jo turned you down. I'm so sorry.

81
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,287
Don't be, Amy. I-- I'm not.

82
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,415
Amy!

83
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:58,708
Amy March!

84
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,919
-Come back here right this instant! Come.
-Aunt March.

85
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,254
Come on.

86
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,548
-Aren't you looking grand?
-Get him off me!

87
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,258
We need to be somewhere. Off you go!

88
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,469
Come to the New Year's Eve party.
Everyone will be there, including Fred.

89
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:13,181
Pick me up at the hotel at 8, The Chavain.

90
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:16,017
And, Laurie, dress for festivities!

91
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,643
Top hats and silks!

92
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,770
I will. I'll wear my best silk.

93
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,861
It's Laurie.

94
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,114
I know.

95
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,793
Twenty yards of the blue silk, as well as pink.
Someone will be by for it later.

96
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:47,256
Meg, that'd look lovely on you.
I know just the dressmaker to send you to.

97
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,134
-You'll be the prettiest wife in Concord.
-Oh, I...

98
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:53,471
John needs a new coat for winter,
and Daisy and Demi need new clothes, I--

99
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:56,724
-And his wife needs a new dress.
-I can't. It's--

100
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,851
I just can't.

101
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:02,396
He'll be so pleased with how you look,
he'll forget all about the expense.

102
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:06,442
I don't suppose it's too much an extravagance.

103
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,486
Will 20 yards do?

104
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,530
-Yes.
-Very good.

105
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,912
Fifty dollars? What was I thinking?

106
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,213
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

107
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:30,883
Oh, my loves.

108
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:34,804
Go play.

109
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,210
Beth!

110
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,255
Beth?

111
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,382
There lies your way, due west.

112
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,301
Then westward ho!

113
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,804
Grace and good disposition attend, Your Ladyship.

114
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:20,224
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

115
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:24,145
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

116
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:27,190
That you do think you are not what you are.

117
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:32,111
-If I think so, I think the same of you.
-Then think you right, I am not what I am.

118
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,724
Like, a big one. Like, a big one... Like that.

119
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:06,729
Excuse me?

120
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,191
I only speak English. I'm sorry, what?

121
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,818
-What did you say?
-Come dance!

122
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,957
I know exactly who I wanna dance with.

123
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,003
-Who will you dance with, Jo?
-I never dance.

124
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:14,213
Why can't we all go? It's not fair.

125
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:17,133
-Wear your regular shoes.
-These fit last winter.

126
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,302
My nose will not look refined.

127
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,470
-I like your nose.
-Now, Jo.

128
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,640
Don't touch me, thanks.
I already feel ridiculous. I don't wanna look it.

129
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,351
-You could be pretty if you tried.
-Don't want to. Won't do it.

130
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,812
I don't want to go, but I wish I could hear the music.

131
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:33,274
-I'll keep it in my head and sing it for you.
-Ought they to smoke like that?

132
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,609
It's the dampness drying.

133
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,569
What a queer smell, like burnt feathers.

134
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:39,572
Now I'll take this off and you'll see a perfect ringlet.

135
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,743
Why is her hair off?

136
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:46,412
-Meg, I'm so sorry.
-What have you done?!

137
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,041
Sorry. You shouldn't have asked me to do it.

138
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,709
Marmee!

139
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,711
I can't go, I'm spoiled!

140
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:55,463
My hair!

141
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:59,675
Don't stare, don't put your hands behind your back,
don't say "Christopher Columbus" or "capital."

142
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,595
-All right.
-Don't shake hands. Don't whistle.

143
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:05,473
Meg March, you look so pretty.

144
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:08,893
Meg.

145
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,410
Thank you.

146
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:29,914
No, it's so early. No.

147
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,123
Fine.

148
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:51,310
-Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.
-Not at all. Stay if you like.

149
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,855
-I won't disturb you?
-No. I don't know many people here.

150
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:56,941
-I felt rather strange at first, you know?
-So do I.

151
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,113
-Miss March, isn't it?
-Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not Miss March.

152
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:05,032
-I'm only Jo.
-And I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.

153
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,622
Don't you dance?

154
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,751
I don't know how you do things here yet.
I've spent most of my life in Europe.

155
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,587
Europe! Oh, that's capital!

156
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:20,756
Shouldn't use words like that.

157
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,970
-Says who?
-Oh, Meg. She's my older sister. Here.

158
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,767
Oh, that's her. See?

159
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:35,563
The girl in the violet dress.

160
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:36,647
It's very pretty.

161
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:42,528
She reminds me to be good,
so Father will be proud when he returns.

162
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:44,030
Where is he?

163
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,282
He volunteered for the Union Army.

164
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:51,162
I wanted to go fight with him.
I can't get over my disappointment in being a girl.

165
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,748
Jo, would you like to dance with me?

166
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:56,083
I can't because...

167
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,126
Because of what?

168
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,423
-You won't tell?
-Never.

169
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,093
I scorched my dress. See? There.

170
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,429
Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it.

171
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,183
You can laugh if you want to. It's funny, I know.

172
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,311
I have an idea of how we can manage.

173
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,789
-What?
-My foot.

174
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,249
I've hurt my ankle.

175
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:19,458
<i>How am I gonna get home?</i>

176
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,753
I don't see what you can do,
except get a carriage or stay here all night.

177
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,715
-Carriages are too expensive.
-Let me take you. It's right next door.

178
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,592
Oh, no, thank you. We cannot accept.

179
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:29,510
You must take mine, please?

180
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:32,388
No. It's so early. You can't mean to leave yet.

181
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,515
I always leave early. I do, truly.

182
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,058
What choice do you have?

183
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,438
-I told you those shoes were too small.
-Goodness gracious...

184
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,522
What have you done?

185
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:43,566
She's lame and can't walk. She's hobbling.

186
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,444
Clear that chair. You're supposed to be asleep.

187
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:48,488
All right, help your sister, then back to bed.

188
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,781
Make room. Meg is a wounded soldier.

189
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,450
I sprained my ankle.

190
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,953
Meg, you'll kill yourself for fashion one of these days.

191
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:59,373
Here. Hannah, we need ice!

192
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,792
-Oh, come in. Come in.
-Is it all right?

193
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:05,421
Apologies for the chaos.
I enjoy baking in the middle of the night.

194
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:08,424
-Don't mind the clutter, Mr. Laurence. We don't.
-Laurie, please.

195
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,551
-Can I call you Teddy?
-Yes.

196
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:14,639
You must be part of their theatricals.
They could use an extra player.

197
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,766
-I'm Amy.
-Hello.

198
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,309
You'll have to fight Jo for the male roles or play a girl.

199
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,187
-Have a scone.
-Yes, thank you.

200
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,521
And ice.

201
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:25,982
-Laurie, how are your ankles? Do you need ice?
-No, thank you, ma'am.

202
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,569
Just call me "mother" or Marmee. Everyone does.

203
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:33,324
-And you wore those pink shoes too, didn't you?
-It's cold.

204
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,370
-Do you want more ice?
-But they look so good, okay?

205
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,665
It feels like being a fine young lady
to come home from a party in a carriage

206
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,500
and have maids wait on me.

207
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,405
<i>For the writer in the attic.</i>

208
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:57,325
Because you enjoyed the play so much tonight,

209
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,076
I wanted you to have this.

210
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:05,208
It will help you study character and paint it with your pen.

211
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,920
<i>I would love to read what you're writing, if you'll trust me.</i>

212
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,508
<i>I promise honesty and whatever intelligence I can muster.</i>

213
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,052
Yours, Friedrich.

214
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:40,409
-Fred, would you like a glass?
-I will. Thank you.

215
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,710
Would you excuse me a second?

216
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:57,760
Laurie.

217
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,054
Amy.

218
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:01,681
I waited an hour for you.

219
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:04,559
I feel caught.

220
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,232
Amy, please. Amy.

221
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:14,152
-Do you want to know what I think of you?
-What do you think of me?

222
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:15,862
-I despise you.
-Why do you despise me?

223
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,406
Because with every chance of being good, happy and useful,

224
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,992
you are lazy, faulty and miserable.

225
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,578
-Interesting.
-Selfish people like to talk about themselves.

226
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:26,038
-Am I selfish?
-Yes, very selfish.

227
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,876
-With your money, talent, beauty, and health--
-Oh, you think I'm beautiful.

228
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,460
Yes, you like that, you old vanity.

229
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:34,714
With all these good things to enjoy,
you can find nothing to do but dawdle.

230
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:40,386
-I'll be good for you, Saint Amy. I'll be good.
-Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that?

231
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,721
No, I'm not.

232
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:45,349
Looks like it's never done a day of work in its life,
and that ring is ridiculous.

233
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,018
Jo gave me this ring.

234
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:51,022
I feel sorry for you. I really do.

235
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,733
I just wish you'd bear it better.

236
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:56,569
You don't have to feel sorry.
You'll feel the same way one day.

237
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,405
No, I'd be respected if I couldn't be loved.

238
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:04,035
What have you done lately, oh, great artiste?

239
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,414
Perhaps you're fantasizing
about spending Fred Vaughn's fortune.

240
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:10,583
Fred Vaughn, ladies and gentlemen!

241
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,801
Fred, I...

242
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:22,011
I'm so sorry.

243
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,904
Those are just stories, of course.

244
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,326
But I'm working on a novel.

245
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:47,954
And your novel...

246
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,331
it will be like this?

247
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,249
Yes.

248
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:53,543
So far, anyway.

249
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,253
With plots like this?

250
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,674
-Duels and killing and--
-It sells, so...

251
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:04,428
-Why don't you sign your real name?
-My mother wouldn't like it.

252
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,391
It's too gory for her.

253
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,102
I wanna help with the money I make, not worry her.

254
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,282
You know, I don't like them.

255
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:27,660
Honestly...

256
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:31,539
I mean, I think that they're not good.

257
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:39,297
But...

258
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,507
They're...

259
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:45,511
They're published in the papers,

260
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:48,764
and people have always said that I'm talented.

261
00:22:48,848 --> 00:22:51,100
Oh, I think you're talented.

262
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,978
Which is why I'm being so... So blunt.

263
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,609
Well, I can't afford to starve on praise.

264
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:01,736
Are you upset?

265
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,654
Of course I'm upset. You just--

266
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:07,074
-You just told me you didn't like my work.
-Jo, I thought you wanted honesty.

267
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,202
I-- Yes, I do.

268
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:13,080
Has no one ever talked to you like this before?

269
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:15,958
Yes, I've been rejected plenty of times.

270
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:20,254
Do you have anyone to take you seriously, Jo,
to talk about your work?

271
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:23,257
And who made you high priest
of what's good and what's bad?

272
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,093
-No one, and I'm not--
-Then why are you acting like it?

273
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:28,679
Your reaction indicates
that you must think there is some truth...

274
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:32,225
My reaction indicates that you are a pompous blowhard.

275
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:33,726
Shakespeare wrote for the masses.

276
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,897
Shakespeare was the greatest poet who ever lived
because he smuggled his poetry in popular works.

277
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,567
-I'm no Shakespeare.
-Thank goodness. We already have him.

278
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:44,862
If you know so much about it,
then why don't you just do it yourself?

279
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:47,281
Because I'm not a writer.

280
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:50,284
-I don't have the gifts you have.
-No, you don't.

281
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:53,037
You will always be a critic, never an author.

282
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,915
The world will forget that you ever even lived.

283
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,459
-Oh, I'm sure they will.
-But...

284
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,710
I-- But I...

285
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:03,297
No one will forget Jo March.

286
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,679
I can believe it.

287
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,847
Listen.

288
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,016
We are not friends. You are not my friend.

289
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,646
I don't want your opinion because I don't like you very much.

290
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:21,357
So just don't talk to me anymore. Thank you.

291
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,629
Oh, Josephine, this came for you.

292
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:44,881
Oh, thank you.

293
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:54,974
Beth.

294
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,186
Merry Christmas, world.

295
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:47,443
Merry Christmas!

296
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:50,154
-Merry Christmas.
-Beth, give me another orange.

297
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,740
-Jo, we've been up for hours.
-What have you been writing?

298
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:55,993
Oh, I got carried away
with our delicious revenge play last night, <i>Poison.</i>

299
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,120
No, no poison. It's Christmas.

300
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:01,582
-Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.
-It's so dreadful being poor.

301
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:05,253
It's not fair. How come some girls have pretty things
and others have nothing at all?

302
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:09,507
-We have Father, Mother and each other.
-We haven't got Father for as long as this war drags on.

303
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,094
I wish I had heaps of money and plenty of servants,
so I never had to work again.

304
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:16,597
Or you could be a proper actress on the boards.
They aren't all fallen women.

305
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:18,140
I can't be an actress.

306
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:21,185
I have lots of wishes,
but my favorite one is to be an artist in Paris

307
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,980
and to do fine pictures and to be the best painter in the world.

308
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,524
That's what you want too, isn't it, Jo? Be a famous writer?

309
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:29,861
-Yes, but it sounds crass when she says it.
-Why be ashamed of what you want?

310
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:33,197
My wish is to have us all to be together
with Father and Mother in this house.

311
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:35,533
-That's what I want.
-Beth is perfect.

312
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:37,577
-Amy.
-What about your music, Queen Beth, huh?

313
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,455
-I do that for us. I don't need anyone else to hear it.
-You must not limit yourself.

314
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,585
Mother proposed not having any presents this year
because our men are suffering in the Army.

315
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:49,130
We can't do much, but we can make
our little sacrifices and do it gladly.

316
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,924
Don't play mother just because she's not home.

317
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:54,719
-Jo, that's so boyish.
-That's why I do it.

318
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:58,264
-I detest rude, unladylike girls.
-I hate affected little chits.

319
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:00,892
-Jo!
-My nose! My nose!

320
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,019
It's already no good!

321
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:04,353
Jo! Jo!

322
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:08,608
I know you don't care what I think,
but you don't want your mother to find you like this, do you?

323
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:12,028
-We care what you think, Hannah.
-You're more family than wicked old Aunt March.

324
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,071
-Oh, don't, Jo.
-Where is Marmee? I'm starving.

325
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:17,074
Goodness only knows. Some poor creature came a-begging.

326
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:19,619
Your ma set off to see what was needed.

327
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:24,290
-I wish she could help others at a time convenient to us.
-Joanna and I are very hungry.

328
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:25,958
Dolls don't get hungry, Beth.

329
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,295
I've rewritten the climax.
We need to set it to memory. Amy, get the costumes.

330
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:31,422
I have made the most divine crown,

331
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:34,383
and I painted my old shoes blue,
so she looks like a princess!

332
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:38,262
-The melancholy piece I've figured out is pretty good.
-Wait until you see this new speech.

333
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:42,099
I don't see how you can write such splendid things, Jo.
You're a regular Shakespeare.

334
00:27:42,183 --> 00:27:45,645
Not quite. Miss Michelangelo,
can you please rehearse the fainting scene?

335
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:47,688
-You're as stiff as a poker.
-I can't help it.

336
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:51,484
I never saw anyone faint before.
I don't intend to make myself all black and blue.

337
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,194
If I can fall down easily, I'll drop.

338
00:27:53,277 --> 00:27:55,863
And if I cannot, I shall fall gracefully into a chair.

339
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:58,658
And I don't care if Hugo comes at me with a pistol.

340
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:00,409
-Hannah?
-I'm not acting.

341
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:03,996
-I didn't even say anything.
-I knew what you were going to say, and I'm not acting.

342
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:17,218
I need both of you to kneel right there.

343
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,262
-I need you to kneel.
-I don't want to kneel.

344
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:22,807
This is supposed to be our special scene,
and no one's gonna be looking at us.

345
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,308
-Smile.
-I don't want to.

346
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:26,978
You have to. And I think Meg should be the director.

347
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:29,438
So I think that she'll need to kneel...

348
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:31,691
-But it's our scene.
-If you'll kneel and look...

349
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,234
Merry Christmas, girls.

350
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,403
-Marmee!
-Oh, merry Christmas!

351
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:39,031
I'm so glad to see you so happy. How's your play?

352
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:41,951
Jo, you look tired. Were you up again all night writing?

353
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,453
-Of course.
-Amy, come kiss me. Thank you.

354
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:46,998
Merry Christmas. How are my girls?

355
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,666
-I'm so hungry.
-Look at this.

356
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:51,169
-I could eat a horse.
-Don't say that, Jo.

357
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:54,005
What?

358
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,757
What is it?

359
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:00,845
Not far from here lives a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel.

360
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:05,766
Her five children are in one bed
to keep from freezing, and there's nothing to eat.

361
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,228
Will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?

362
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,569
Is this where you say that Father would want us to?

363
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:18,488
Yes.

364
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:31,167
Thank you.

365
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,670
And thank you, Mr. Laurence, for including me.

366
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:35,838
You're welcome.

367
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:43,638
Perhaps you could tutor my grandson in manners,

368
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,723
as well as mathematics, huh?

369
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:54,649
Oh, girls...

370
00:29:57,235 --> 00:29:58,194
Be careful.

371
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,699
Watch yourselves.

372
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:05,618
Out here with no sleeves.

373
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:23,052
It is good angels come to us.

374
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,806
Hello.

375
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:30,142
I'm back. And have food and blankets.

376
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,602
And sweaters.

377
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,437
And we brought some medicine.

378
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,273
So these are my girls.

379
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:36,440
Say hello.

380
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:37,608
He is not well.

381
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,653
Girls, why don't you unpack the food?

382
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:42,363
Would you like some?

383
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,493
You want one?

384
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:49,579
Yeah, have it all.

385
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,914
-Why don't we put some firewood?
-It's good, isn't it?

386
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:56,794
That's nice, huh?

387
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:05,928
-Marmee, we don't need our toes.
-I think I've lost one.

388
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:07,847
Has anyone else lost their toe?

389
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:13,060
-That was amazing.
-I can't even feel my feet anymore.

390
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:16,814
Is it fairies?

391
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:18,024
Santa Claus.

392
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:20,610
-No, it's old Aunt March.
-Mr. Laurence sent it.

393
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:23,112
-The Laurence boy's grandfather?
-Yes.

394
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,030
Why?

395
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:27,867
He saw you giving your Christmas breakfast away
and he wanted you to enjoy the day.

396
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,745
-But I thought he was a mean old man.
-It's so generous of him.

397
00:31:30,828 --> 00:31:33,998
His grandson, Laurie,
put the idea into his head. I know he did.

398
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:36,000
We should make friends with him.

399
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,295
Boys scare me, and that big old house scares me.

400
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:43,466
Jenny Snow says that Mr. Laurence disowned his son
after he went off with an Italian woman.

401
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:45,343
Now his grandson is an orphan

402
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:48,262
and spends all of his time in that house,
locked up with his tutor.

403
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:52,225
He's a very kind man who lost his little girl
when she was only a child.

404
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,185
-Now his son as well.
-His daughter died?

405
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:57,897
-That's so sad.
-But doesn't Laurie just seem so romantic? He's half Italian.

406
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,899
What do you know? You've barely spoken to him.

407
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:03,778
I'm not responsible for this feast, but I have got a surprise.

408
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:05,947
-Is he coming home?
-A letter from Father!

409
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:08,157
Don't I wish I could go?

410
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,493
Jo, we can't give up our only brother.

411
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:12,578
It must be so disagreeable to sleep in a tent.

412
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:15,456
-Jo sits in the back, so we can't see her cry.
-So, what if I do?

413
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,085
-Will he be coming home?
-He'll stay and work faithfully as long as he can.

414
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:22,672
And we won't ask for him to come back
a minute sooner than he can be spared.

415
00:32:24,382 --> 00:32:26,759
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

416
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:30,763
Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night

417
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:33,933
and find my best comforts in their affection at all times.

418
00:32:34,016 --> 00:32:37,478
A year seems a very long time to wait before I see them.

419
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:42,817
But remind them that while we wait,
we may all work, so these hard days...

420
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,777
need not be wasted.

421
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:48,322
<i>I know that they will be loving children to you.</i>

422
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:51,409
<i>Do their duty faithfully.</i>

423
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:54,412
<i>Fight their enemies bravely.</i>

424
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,958
<i>And conquer themselves so beautifully."</i>

425
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,961
<i>The Witch's Curse, a</i> play by Jo March.

426
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:06,257
Make it sweet and swift and strong...

427
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,261
<i>-"That when I come back to them..."
</i>-Spirit, answer now my song.

428
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,345
<i>"...I may be...</i>

429
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,558
<i>fonder and prouder than ever...</i>

430
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:18,769
<i>of my little women."</i>

431
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:21,647
Brava!

432
00:33:25,318 --> 00:33:27,862
Excuse me. Excuse me.

433
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,656
Excuse me. Your stop, ma'am.

434
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,825
Oh, thank you.

435
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:34,869
<i>She's gone? Why?</i>

436
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:37,246
I don't know. She just left.

437
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,083
-But she didn't say if she was coming back?
-We didn't have a heart-to-heart, professor.

438
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:44,837
Why are you just sitting there?
Please, go, go. Dust something.

439
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,882
And what about the girls?
She was the best teacher they ever had.

440
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:48,966
I know.

441
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,023
<i>It is so hard to go back to work after such good times.</i>

442
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:07,360
-I wish it was Christmas every day.
-Or New Year's. Wouldn't that be exciting?

443
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:09,570
We are a bunch of ungrateful minxes.

444
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:13,241
-Jo! Don't say such despicable things.
-I like good, strong words that mean something.

445
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:16,118
-I have to go back to school, and I don't have any limes.
-Limes?

446
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:20,331
All the girls are trading pickled limes,
and I'm in debt. I owe ever so many limes.

447
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:22,041
-Will this do?
-What'd you do that for?

448
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,333
Meg, thank you.

449
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:26,920
I know what it is to want little things
and feel less than other girls.

450
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,340
-That and the drawings will wipe out my debt.
-Drawings?

451
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:32,717
Nothing. I'm just glad Mother doesn't
make me go to school with those girls.

452
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,011
Hurry. I'll be late.

453
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:37,807
Beth, after your shopping, I need you to work your way
through the new sums and spelling.

454
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,101
-I'll check it all when I get home, all right?
-Fine.

455
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:41,101
Bye.

456
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,125
-Josephine.
-Yes?

457
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,670
-Josephine.
-Yes? Here.

458
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:11,549
Is there a reason you stopped reading Belsham?

459
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:12,717
I'm sorry.

460
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,843
I'll continue.

461
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:17,013
You mind yourself, deary.

462
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:20,892
Someday you'll need me
and you'll wish you had behaved better.

463
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:23,853
Thank you, Aunt March, for your employment
and your many kindnesses,

464
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:26,355
but I intend to make my way in the world.

465
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,940
Oh, well.

466
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:30,568
No. No one makes their own way.

467
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,153
Not really.

468
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:35,406
Least of all, a woman. You'll need to marry well.

469
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,284
-But you are not married.
-That's because I'm rich.

470
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,620
And I made sure to keep hold of my money.

471
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:43,122
Unlike your father.

472
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:46,167
So the only way to be an unmarried woman is to be rich?

473
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,084
Yes.

474
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:50,838
-There are precious few ways for women to make money.
-That's not true.

475
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:52,715
You could run a cathouse.

476
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:54,926
Or go on the stage.

477
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:57,136
Practically the same thing.

478
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,305
Other than that, you're right.

479
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:01,516
Precious few ways for women.

480
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,810
-That's why you should heed me.
-So I can get married.

481
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:09,273
No. So you can live a better life than your poor mother has.

482
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:12,902
-But Marmee loves her life.
-You don't know what she loves.

483
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:19,408
Your father cared more about educating freedmen's children
than he did about caring for his own family.

484
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:20,993
Yes, but he was right.

485
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:24,372
Well, it's possible to be right and foolish.

486
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:25,832
Well, I don't think so.

487
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:27,792
Well, you're not paid to think.

488
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:36,217
I know you don't care much about marriage now.

489
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:40,096
Can't say I blame you.

490
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:48,479
But I intend to go to Europe one more time
and I need a companion,

491
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:50,773
so how would you like to be the person I take?

492
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:54,485
-I'd like that more than anything.
-All right, then read.

493
00:36:55,194 --> 00:36:57,113
And don't sneak around.

494
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:59,615
I don't like sneaks.

495
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:03,494
<i>President Lincoln.</i>

496
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,121
No, Father's fighting for him.

497
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:08,875
My father says the war is a waste
and we should just let them keep their labor.

498
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,418
Susan, it is immoral.

499
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,546
Everyone benefited from the system, including you Marches.

500
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:16,674
-Why should only the South be punished?
-Maybe we should all be punished.

501
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:20,428
-The Marches love a cause.
-Fine. Just do Mr. Davis.

502
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:27,143
-I don't know if I should.
-I'll wipe out your debt and give you five limes.

503
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:29,937
...your spelling and, moreover, your reading habit.

504
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:45,745
Miss March.

505
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:49,874
<i>Sit down.</i>

506
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:53,211
Sit down, Laurie.

507
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,421
Latin is a privilege.

508
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,298
Please, you have to learn this.

509
00:37:57,381 --> 00:38:00,134
I can't afford to lose this position. Just return to the Cicero--

510
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,386
-There's a girl out there.
-No, there is not.

511
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,473
-Yes, Mr. Brooke, there is a girl.
-No, there's not.

512
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,648
I'll never get to go home again.

513
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,691
-There is a girl.
-That's a girl.

514
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,320
Hello there. Are you hurt?

515
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:22,156
-I'm Amy.
-Hello, Amy. I'm Laurie.

516
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,784
I know. You brought my sister back after the dance.

517
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,953
I would've never have sprained my ankle.

518
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,956
I have lovely small feet, the best in the family.

519
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,502
But I can never go home again because I'm in such trouble.

520
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,295
Look.

521
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,798
Mr. Davis hit me.

522
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:45,304
Tell the servants I want this painting purchased for me.

523
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:47,932
-Amy! Are you in here?
-Meg! My hand. Look.

524
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,517
-Jo.
-What richness.

525
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,935
It hurts so much.

526
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:53,229
You ought to be the happiest boy in the world.

527
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:55,231
-A fellow can't live on books alone.
-I could.

528
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:59,026
-What did you do?
-I did a drawing, and then Mr. Davis hit me.

529
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,863
-Oh, Christopher Columbus, look at that.
-That's my grandfather.

530
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:04,323
-Are you scared of him?
-No, I'm not scared of anyone.

531
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:07,160
He looks stern,
but my grandfather was much more handsome.

532
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:09,036
Jo, we do not compare grandfathers.

533
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,080
You think he's more handsome, eh?

534
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:16,335
-No, actually, you are very handsome. I didn't mean--
-I knew your mother's father.

535
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,337
You've got his spirit.

536
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:21,215
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

537
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,513
-You are not to attend that school anymore.
-Good. That man has always been an idiot.

538
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:30,141
-Jo will teach you.
-Me? I already teach Beth.

539
00:39:30,224 --> 00:39:31,225
You're a good teacher.

540
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,312
Yes, women being taught at home
is much more proper, I believe.

541
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:38,024
-Only because the schools for women are so poor.
-Indeed. Quite right.

542
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:40,902
I wish all the girls would leave his school
and that he would die.

543
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:45,198
-Amy, you did wrong and there will be consequences.
-I didn't even do anything. I just did a drawing.

544
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:48,951
-Thank you so much for taking care of Amy.
-Oh, yes, of course.

545
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:51,704
My girls have a way of getting into mischief.

546
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:52,997
Well, so do I.

547
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,416
Then you'll run over and we'll take care of you.

548
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,919
Come over whenever you'd like. Invite Beth as well.

549
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:01,255
-Yes! Beth would adore the piano.
-Is she the quiet one?

550
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,673
Yes, that's our Beth.

551
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:05,343
-Tell that little girl to use our piano.
-Thank you.

552
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:07,136
Jo, borrow whatever book you'd like.

553
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,055
-Can I come look at the paintings?
-Yes.

554
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:10,848
There's also a lovely greenhouse.

555
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:13,559
We must go. Girls.

556
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:18,022
-Mr. Laurence, can you please buy this painting?
-I'm going to take this. If that's okay.

557
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:20,525
-I'll bring it back soon. I promise you.
-Thank you again.

558
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:21,943
Thank you for my hand!

559
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:23,528
-Thank you!
-Goodbye.

560
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,658
Oh, Miss Meg?

561
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,743
You forgot your glove.

562
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,671
Well, back to work.

563
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:42,922
Back to work.

564
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:00,022
Order!

565
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:03,359
Order. Order. Order!

566
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:08,531
A new play written by Miss Jo March
will appear at the Barnville Theater

567
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:11,701
in the course of the next few weeks that will surpass

568
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:15,663
anything ever seen before on the American stage.

569
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:20,459
Starring the greatest actress from here
to the Mississippi River, Miss Meg March.

570
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,546
Yes. There we go. Very good. Excellent. Bravo.

571
00:41:23,629 --> 00:41:26,549
Weekly report. Meg good, Jo bad.

572
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:30,595
Beth very good. And Amy sort of middling.

573
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:32,763
-Very well done, sirs.
-Excellent.

574
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:34,932
-Excellent, excellent.
-Bravo.

575
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:36,851
Mr. President and gentlemen,

576
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:39,896
I wish to propose the admission of a new member.

577
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:43,357
One who would be deeply, deeply grateful

578
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:48,362
and would add immensely to the spirit of the club.

579
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:49,864
I propose...

580
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:54,368
Mr. Theodore Laurence!

581
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:56,704
-Absolutely not.
-No.

582
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:59,832
-What? Come, now. Let's have him.
-He's a real boy.

583
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,877
-We don't want any boys. This is a club for ladies.
-Yes.

584
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,295
-I think we should do it.
-Why?

585
00:42:04,378 --> 00:42:06,297
-Even if we are afraid, I say yes.
-Why?

586
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,840
-It's Laurie.
-What? No.

587
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,091
It'll change everything.

588
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:11,511
I call a vote. Put your hands up. "Aye, aye, aye."

589
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:14,305
-Don't put her hand up.
-Put your hand up. It's Laurie.

590
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:15,640
Fine. Aye.

591
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:17,600
And as there is no time like the present...

592
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:21,354
Ladies, ladies, please, please.

593
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:26,567
This is my stratagem. I deserve the blame.
Jo only gave in to it after lots of teasing.

594
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:28,027
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

595
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:32,532
I merely wish to say as a slight token of my gratitude that I...

596
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:35,368
-Yes, yes.
-Go on.

597
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:40,081
As a means of promoting friendly relations
between adjoining nations.

598
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:43,125
And thus, I propose this set of keys

599
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:47,922
for a little post office I've made in the forest by the pond.

600
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:50,842
Yes, four keys. They're for you, darling.

601
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:54,929
-Meg, yes, yes. And for you.
-Oh, thank you very much.

602
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:57,807
This is for me. And without further ado,
thank you for your favor.

603
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,934
I will take my seat as part of the club.

604
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:06,983
-Yes, well. Of course. Yes, yes.
-Bravo, bravo.

605
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:09,944
Welcome, Laurie.

606
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:25,835
-Three, four, five.
-You both got five.

607
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:28,171
-I asked the doctor.
-That's a draw, I think.

608
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:31,007
-It doesn't make sense.
-I know. I can't believe it.

609
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,466
Hello.

610
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,593
Jo!

611
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,350
Daisy and Demi! Can I have a hug?

612
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,186
Oh, you've gotten so big.

613
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:47,732
-I wish you were here to teach them.
-I know. Well, I'm here now.

614
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:50,026
-So good to have you home.
-Take this off.

615
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,905
I think the loneliness got to Beth,
though she ain't said anything.

616
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:57,325
-Where is Beth?
-She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo.

617
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:01,871
We all thought she was better,
but the fever'd weakened her heart.

618
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,875
Take this and find her the best doctor you can.

619
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,794
-You need this money to live in New York.
-No, I'm not going back.

620
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:11,464
I'm using the rest to take her to the sea and get her strong.

621
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,427
When's Amy coming home?

622
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:20,348
-We didn't want to worry her.
-Does she not know?

623
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:27,146
Beth insisted we not tell her
because she didn't want to ruin Amy's trip.

624
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:34,654
Amy has always had a talent
for getting out of the hard parts of life.

625
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,906
Jo, don't be angry with your sister.

626
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:47,667
I can't seem to find anything.

627
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,170
-Marmee, have you seen my glove?
-When did you last see it?

628
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:56,092
Jo! Jo, where are you?

629
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,177
-I can't find my other glove.
-Take mine.

630
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:00,513
-Jo, we're going to be late.
-Where are you going?

631
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:02,056
You're not invited.

632
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:06,269
-You're going somewhere with Laurie. I know it.
-Yes, we are. Now, stop bothering.

633
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:07,937
-You have the tickets?
-Yes. Hurry up.

634
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,399
You're going to the theater with Laurie.
Meg, can I come? Please, can I come?

635
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:15,361
-I'm sorry, but you weren't invited.
-You can't go, so don't be a baby and whine about it.

636
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:17,864
I've been shut up here, and I never get to go anywhere.

637
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:21,492
-Beth has her piano, and I'm lonely.
-I can teach you chords.

638
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:23,870
I don't want chords. I want to go to the theater.

639
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:26,789
No. I think you'd hate to poke yourself in
where you're not wanted.

640
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:30,126
-We already have to deal with dull Mr. Brooke.
-I like him. He's kind.

641
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,879
-But I can pay for myself.
-You will not come.

642
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:34,797
I'm sorry, my sweet, but Jo is right.

643
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,299
-No! Please.
-Next time.

644
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:39,510
-Come, Meg. Stop petting her.
-Please, please, please!

645
00:45:39,594 --> 00:45:42,054
-You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
-Amy!

646
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:44,557
You will! You'll regret this!

647
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:49,520
Stop looking at me like that!

648
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:45,618
-I loved every second of it.
-Jo!

649
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:49,872
-I thought the actress was--
-Very, very good.

650
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:53,167
-Yes, she was really good.
-She was. She was very good.

651
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:10,893
Bye!

652
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:13,062
Oh, I love the theater.

653
00:47:13,145 --> 00:47:17,441
Meg, you're a million times better than she was.
Although she was a terrific fainter.

654
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,777
I wonder how she managed to turn so white as she did.

655
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:22,238
That Mr. Brooke, could he be any more obsequious?

656
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:26,075
-I thought he was very well-mannered.
-Hold on. Let me just get this idea down.

657
00:47:32,707 --> 00:47:35,042
-Beth, what's your favorite eye color?
-Purple.

658
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:39,130
Mr. Brooke has blue eyes and an old soul,
which is much more important than money.

659
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:40,756
Has anyone taken my novel?

660
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,176
-No.
-No. Why?

661
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:55,813
Amy, you've got it.

662
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:57,607
-No, I haven't.
-That's a lie.

663
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,276
I haven't got it, I don't know where it is, and I don't care.

664
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,986
Tell me, or I'll make you!

665
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:04,197
-I burnt it up!
-Marmee!

666
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,451
I burnt your book. I told you I'd make you pay, and I did!

667
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:11,120
All right, Jo! Jo! Jo! Please get off her!

668
00:48:11,204 --> 00:48:12,830
Jo. Amy.

669
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:14,832
-Get her off!
-I hate you!

670
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:23,257
I'm sorry, Jo.

671
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:25,718
Amy.

672
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,852
It's just that the only thing you care about is your writing.

673
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:38,356
And it's not as if I could've hurt you
by ruining one of your dresses,

674
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:40,358
and I really did want to hurt you.

675
00:48:42,235 --> 00:48:45,238
I am the most sorry for it now. I'm so sorry.

676
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:47,532
Jo...

677
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,868
don't let the sun go down on your anger.

678
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:52,662
Forgive her.

679
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:54,080
Help each other.

680
00:48:55,206 --> 00:48:56,999
And you begin again tomorrow.

681
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:01,337
She doesn't deserve my forgiveness.

682
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:05,383
And I will hate her. I will hate her forever!

683
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:38,624
Good morning. Brisk and brilliant outside today.

684
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,459
-Last day at the river. Get your skates.
-Let's go!

685
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:43,379
Jo, you promised me I could come last time. Jo!

686
00:49:46,257 --> 00:49:48,176
Is she going to be like this forever?

687
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,345
It was a very hard loss for her.

688
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,598
Is there nothing I can do?

689
00:49:55,808 --> 00:50:00,229
Go after her. Don't say anything
till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,

690
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:02,315
and then just say some kind thing.

691
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:03,941
I'm sure she'll be friends again.

692
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,944
Jo, wait!

693
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:08,863
I'm coming!

694
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,199
You said I could come last time!

695
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:16,120
Jo, Laurie, wait! I'm coming!

696
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,122
Wait!

697
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,875
Jo!

698
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,211
Stay near the edge. It's not safe in the middle.

699
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:25,087
-Got it.
-Jo!

700
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:31,135
Jo, I'm coming!

701
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:37,683
Jo!

702
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,020
Jo, let's go!

703
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:47,652
Jo, wait!

704
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:56,244
Jo!

705
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:07,922
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

706
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:11,509
-Help! Help me!
-Amy. It's Amy.

707
00:51:11,592 --> 00:51:13,135
Come on. Come on, Jo.

708
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:14,136
Jo!

709
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,222
Jo!

710
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:19,684
Jo, get a branch. Get a branch.

711
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:21,686
-Amy.
-Jo!

712
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:23,646
Amy. Amy.

713
00:51:23,729 --> 00:51:24,730
Help!

714
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:26,357
I can't breathe!

715
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,528
Jo, help me pull. Amy, grab the branch. Grab it, Amy.

716
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:43,666
I'm so sorry. Oh, my sister, my sister.

717
00:51:48,796 --> 00:51:50,131
She's asleep.

718
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,386
If she had died, it would have been my fault.

719
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,347
She'll be fine.

720
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:02,977
The doctor said that he didn't even think she'd catch cold.

721
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,105
What is wrong with me?

722
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,983
I've made so many resolutions,

723
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:12,820
and I've written sad notes, and I've cried over my sins...

724
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:17,200
but it just doesn't seem to help.

725
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:22,872
When I get in a passion, I get so savage.

726
00:52:22,955 --> 00:52:25,416
I could hurt anyone, and I'd enjoy it.

727
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:28,586
You remind me of myself.

728
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,215
But you're never angry.

729
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,052
I'm angry nearly every day of my life.

730
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:38,262
You are?

731
00:52:39,514 --> 00:52:41,599
I am not patient by nature.

732
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,229
But with nearly 40 years of effort,

733
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:48,773
I'm learning to not let it get the better of me.

734
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:53,820
Well, I'll do the same, then.

735
00:52:55,822 --> 00:52:58,491
I hope you'll do a great deal better than me.

736
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:05,498
There are some natures too noble to curb

737
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:07,917
and too lofty to bend.

738
00:53:28,729 --> 00:53:29,689
Jo.

739
00:53:30,731 --> 00:53:32,817
Oh, Beth, my love.

740
00:53:35,653 --> 00:53:38,823
-You didn't need to come.
-I never should have left.

741
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:41,534
Do you need anything? Here.

742
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:42,952
Take some water.

743
00:53:46,664 --> 00:53:48,583
It's so good to see your face.

744
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:52,128
We're going to the sea to get you strong and well.

745
00:53:52,211 --> 00:53:55,339
-The sea?
-I want you dancing by the time Amy gets back.

746
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,010
-She's not cutting her trip short, is she?
-No, no.

747
00:53:59,093 --> 00:54:00,303
Good.

748
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:02,847
Is there any news? What does she say?

749
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,099
She writes that Laurie is there.

750
00:54:05,183 --> 00:54:06,601
I'm glad he's with her.

751
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:10,104
He won't respond to any of my letters.

752
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:12,690
Do you miss him?

753
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:15,526
I miss everything.

754
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:18,571
I know.

755
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:25,661
-Hurry up, you two! Meg's gonna be gone for a week.
-We're coming!

756
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:27,955
You take the other carriage, Laurie, and spy on Meg.

757
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,916
-Make sure she doesn't fall in love.
-I will.

758
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,502
It was nice of Annie to invite me to her debutante ball.

759
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:35,755
-Thank you for letting me go.
-Just be who you are.

760
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,717
And wear this to the ball. It was mine when I was your age.

761
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,470
I've never understood saving jewelry until marriage.

762
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:46,974
You should have something that's just yours.
Pretty things should be enjoyed.

763
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:49,268
Yes, pretty things should be enjoyed.

764
00:54:50,645 --> 00:54:51,687
-Can I see it?
-Hannah!

765
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:53,648
I wish I could go to the debutante ball.

766
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,776
Do you think this is a good idea, her going away like this?

767
00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:00,196
Girls have to go into the world
and make up their own minds about things.

768
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,990
-Don't forget about us.
-I won't, Jo. It's only a week.

769
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:04,992
-It's beautiful.
-It's not yours.

770
00:55:05,076 --> 00:55:08,579
-It would look very good on me.
-She needs to have some decent shoes.

771
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:13,167
Thank you for the carriage, Mr. Laurence.
I don't know how to repay you.

772
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:14,627
Nonsense, nonsense.

773
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,130
-I said hi to the horses. They're very nice.
-Although there is one thing.

774
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:22,552
It occurred to me today
that my daughter's piano suffers from want of use.

775
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:26,472
Any of your girls like to run over
and practice on it now and then?

776
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:31,185
Just to keep it in tune.
If they don't care to come, why, then never mind.

777
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:34,230
Oh, sir, they do care.

778
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:35,439
Very, very much.

779
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:39,026
-You're the musical girl?
-I love it dearly.

780
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:43,656
And I'll come if you are quite sure
nobody will hear me and be disturbed.

781
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,491
Not a soul, my dear.

782
00:55:49,787 --> 00:55:50,913
-Miss you.
-Bye.

783
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,331
-Can I borrow your ribbons?
-No.

784
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,084
-Bye!
-Be good. Enjoy the ball.

785
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:58,045
-Bye. I'll be back soon.
-Don't go and get married.

786
00:55:58,129 --> 00:55:59,213
Don't go fall in love.

787
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:00,715
-Come back right now.
-I love you.

788
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:02,884
-Right this second.
-Right this second.

789
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,521
Whoa there.

790
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,613
Thank you.

791
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,388
I'd be so excited about tonight.

792
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:53,518
-Of course.
-Oh, no, I don't actually...

793
00:56:55,436 --> 00:56:57,522
What dress will you wear tonight, Meg?

794
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:00,983
-I will wear this one.
-That one? Can't you send home for another?

795
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:03,611
-I haven't got another.
-Only the one? Oh, that's so funny.

796
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:04,987
Not at all.

797
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:09,534
There's no need in sending home, Daisy.
I'm going to call you Daisy now.

798
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:13,120
I've got a sweet pink dress laid away,
and you'll wear it to please me, won't you, Daisy?

799
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:16,207
-If it's all right.
-Of course.

800
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:55,454
Everyone's in love with you, Daisy.

801
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,166
-You have to keep my dress.
-I can't keep your dress.

802
00:57:58,249 --> 00:57:59,667
-You have to. Please.
-No.

803
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,085
I love seeing you in it.

804
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:05,339
Have fun, little Daisy.

805
00:58:05,423 --> 00:58:07,925
Laurie. I didn't know you were going to come.

806
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:09,677
Supposed to be a surprise.

807
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,597
And what a lovely surprise it is.

808
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,641
-Why are they calling you Daisy?
-It's their pet name for me.

809
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,812
Meg is a perfectly good name.

810
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:24,484
It's just like playing a part to be Daisy for a little while.

811
00:58:29,155 --> 00:58:30,490
What would Jo say?

812
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:38,039
You wouldn't actually marry one of these men, would you?

813
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,209
I might.

814
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,337
You'll get a terrible headache tomorrow.

815
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:51,594
Do you like how I look?

816
00:58:51,677 --> 00:58:53,137
No, I don't.

817
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:55,932
Why not?

818
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,975
I don't like fuss and feathers.

819
00:58:59,227 --> 00:59:01,187
You're the rudest boy I ever saw.

820
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,031
Please forgive me and come dance.

821
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:38,201
I'm afraid it would be too disagreeable for you.

822
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:42,788
I don't like your dress, but I think you are just splendid.

823
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,627
-Really?
-Really.

824
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:55,426
I know it's silly, but please don't tell Jo.

825
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:00,014
Let me have my fun tonight.
I'll be desperately good for the rest of my life.

826
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:32,964
I'm sorry, John.

827
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,926
The silk was the first real expense.

828
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:44,559
Fifty dollars, while a lot, is not, I suppose,

829
01:01:44,642 --> 01:01:49,438
too much for a dress with all the notions
that are needed to finish it these days.

830
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:56,696
It's not exactly even a dress yet. It's...

831
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,366
It's just the fabric.

832
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,289
I see.

833
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,584
I know you're angry, John.

834
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,878
I don't mean to waste your money, but I can't resist

835
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:15,298
when I see Sallie buying all she wants
and pitying me because I don't.

836
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:21,304
I try to be contented, but it is hard.

837
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:23,681
And I'm tired of being poor.

838
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,186
I was afraid of this.

839
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,189
I do my best, Meg.

840
01:02:31,272 --> 01:02:32,732
Oh, John.

841
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,985
My dear, kind, hardworking boy.

842
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:38,738
It was so ungrateful and wicked.

843
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:41,657
How could I say it?

844
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:44,994
-Perhaps you meant it.
-No, I didn't.

845
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,455
We'll work out a way to get you your coat as well,

846
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:50,500
and then won't we be grand, the two of us?

847
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,210
I can't afford it, my dear.

848
01:02:53,211 --> 01:02:55,046
-John.
-I need to go to bed.

849
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,173
John.

850
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:05,890
And I really am very sorry that you've had to do
without so many beautiful things...

851
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,685
and that you're married to someone
who can't give them to you.

852
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,365
Hello, Amy.

853
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:24,158
I don't want to see you.

854
01:03:24,242 --> 01:03:27,078
Don't be mad at me. I'm sorry for how I behaved.

855
01:03:27,161 --> 01:03:28,454
Have you been drinking again?

856
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,833
-Why are you being so hard on me? It's 4 p.m.
-Someone has to do it.

857
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,879
When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?

858
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:37,880
Never.

859
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:40,091
"Never"? What? Why?

860
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,134
I'm a failure.

861
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,221
Jo is in New York being a writer, and I'm a failure.

862
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:47,348
That's quite a statement to make at 20.

863
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:51,477
Rome took all the vanity out of me,
and Paris made me realize I'd never be a genius,

864
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,856
-so I'm giving up all my foolish artistic hopes.
-Why should you give up?

865
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:58,151
-You have so much talent and energy.
-Talent isn't genius.

866
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,820
And no amount of energy can make it so.

867
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,072
I want to be great or nothing.

868
01:04:03,156 --> 01:04:07,910
And I will not be some commonplace dauber,
and I don't intend to try anymore.

869
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:16,169
What women are allowed into the club of geniuses anyway?

870
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:20,798
The Brontës?

871
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:23,885
-That's it?
-Yes, I think so.

872
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:26,679
And who always declares genius?

873
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:30,016
-Men, I suppose.
-They're cutting down the competition.

874
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:33,144
That's a very complicated argument to make me feel better.

875
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:34,770
Do you though? Do you feel better?

876
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:40,902
-I do think, male or female, I am of middling talent.
-"Middling talent"?

877
01:04:47,408 --> 01:04:50,495
Then may I ask your last portrait be of me?

878
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:51,412
All right.

879
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:55,583
Now that you've given up all your foolish artistic hopes...

880
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,418
what are you gonna do with your life?

881
01:04:57,502 --> 01:05:01,589
Polish up all my other talents
and become an ornament to society.

882
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:04,842
That's where Fred Vaughn comes in, I suppose.

883
01:05:04,926 --> 01:05:07,595
-Don't make fun.
-I said his name.

884
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,848
-You're not engaged, I hope.
-No.

885
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:17,355
But you will be if he goes down properly on one knee?

886
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:20,483
Most likely, yes.

887
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,153
He's rich. Richer than you, even.

888
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:26,948
I understand queens of society can't get on without money,

889
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:30,576
although it does sound odd from the mouth
of one of your mother's girls.

890
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:36,123
I've always known I would marry rich.
Why should I be ashamed of that?

891
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:39,210
It's nothing to be ashamed of, as long as you love him.

892
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:41,796
I believe we have some power over who we love.

893
01:05:41,879 --> 01:05:44,090
It isn't something that just happens to a person.

894
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,592
I think the poets might disagree.

895
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,511
Well, I'm not a poet.

896
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:50,012
I'm just a woman.

897
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:54,892
And as a woman, there's no way for me
to make my own money.

898
01:05:56,477 --> 01:06:00,857
Not enough to earn a living or to support my family.

899
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,151
If I had my own money, which I don't,

900
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:06,320
that money would belong to my husband
the moment we got married.

901
01:06:06,404 --> 01:06:09,323
If we had children, they would be his, not mine.

902
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:10,575
They would be his property.

903
01:06:10,658 --> 01:06:15,580
So don't sit there and tell me that marriage isn't
an economic proposition because it is.

904
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:20,293
It may not be for you, but it most certainly is for me.

905
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:25,965
Oh, that's Fred. Can you unbutton me, please?

906
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:45,109
Thank you.

907
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,951
How do I look? Do I look all right?

908
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:55,745
You look beautiful.

909
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,666
You are beautiful.

910
01:07:10,676 --> 01:07:12,595
Fred!

911
01:07:12,678 --> 01:07:14,222
I've missed you.

912
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:36,452
This is Fred Vaughn and his sister, Kate.
Course you know Mr. Brooke.

913
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:38,788
This is Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo.

914
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:42,291
-So pleased to meet you.
-Oh, how elegant.

915
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:46,712
I'm Amy March. You remember that name.
I'm gonna come find you one day in London.

916
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,172
Oh, I certainly will.

917
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:13,948
-Oh, that missed a boat.
-That's very kind.

918
01:08:16,868 --> 01:08:18,619
-Well...
-Sorry.

919
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:20,329
I know something you don't know.

920
01:08:20,413 --> 01:08:23,624
-Tell me this second.
-Has Meg perhaps mislaid a glove?

921
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,252
-Mr. Brooke has it!
-Yes.

922
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:27,587
-How do you know?
-I saw it.

923
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:28,671
-Where?
-In his pocket.

924
01:08:28,754 --> 01:08:30,589
-All this time?
-Yes. Isn't it romantic?

925
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,967
-No, it's horrid.
-I thought you'd be pleased.

926
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:36,345
At the idea of anybody coming
to take Meg away? No, thank you.

927
01:08:36,428 --> 01:08:38,806
You'll feel better when somebody comes to take you away.

928
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:42,810
-I'd like to see anyone try it.
-I would like to see someone try as well.

929
01:08:48,774 --> 01:08:51,276
<i>"We could never have loved the earth so well</i>

930
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:54,363
<i>if we had had no childhood in it,</i>

931
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:59,785
<i>if it were not the earth
where the same flowers come up again every spring</i>

932
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:03,455
<i>that we used to gather with our tiny fingers.</i>

933
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:06,667
<i>What novelty is worth that sweet monotony</i>

934
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,712
where everything is known and loved

935
01:09:09,794 --> 01:09:11,506
because it is known?"

936
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:14,174
How great is that?

937
01:09:15,676 --> 01:09:17,303
I love to listen to you read, Jo,

938
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,013
but I just love it better
when you read the stories you've written.

939
01:09:20,388 --> 01:09:22,266
I don't have any new stories.

940
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,351
Why not?

941
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,689
Haven't written any.

942
01:09:30,107 --> 01:09:33,361
You have a pencil and paper.
Sit here and write me something.

943
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,446
I can't.

944
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:41,035
I don't think I can anymore.

945
01:09:41,118 --> 01:09:41,953
Why?

946
01:09:42,537 --> 01:09:46,707
It's just... no one even cares to hear my stories anyway.

947
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,086
Write something for me.

948
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:53,172
You are a writer.

949
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,716
Even before anyone knew or paid you.

950
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,302
I'm very sick, and you must do what I say.

951
01:10:00,721 --> 01:10:02,849
Do what Marmee taught us to do.

952
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,475
Do it for someone else.

953
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:11,732
If you're walking to Vermont,
there's a Mrs. Sewall in Keene, New Hampshire,

954
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,360
-who will give you room and board.
-There you are.

955
01:10:14,902 --> 01:10:17,113
You should go home. I can take care of this.

956
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:19,448
No, I need to be here.

957
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:21,951
I've spent my whole life ashamed of my country.

958
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:25,121
No offense meant, but you should still be ashamed.

959
01:10:25,204 --> 01:10:26,914
I know. I am.

960
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,507
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, ma'am.

961
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:38,050
Do you have sons in the Army?

962
01:10:39,427 --> 01:10:41,179
Yes, ma'am. I had four.

963
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:45,558
But two were killed, and one is a prisoner.

964
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:49,604
I'm going to the other,
who's very sick in a Washington hospital.

965
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:54,358
You've done a great deal for your country, sir.

966
01:10:55,026 --> 01:11:00,281
I'd go myself if I was any use, but as I ain't, I give my boys.

967
01:11:03,784 --> 01:11:06,329
Sir, I'll get you a blanket...

968
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,877
to keep you warm.

969
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:19,926
-Thank you. God bless.
-Bless you, sir.

970
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,846
Mrs. March. Telegram from Washington, ma'am.

971
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:28,309
-Is Jo back yet from Aunt March?
-No, I haven't seen her yet.

972
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:30,686
-I've got it!
-You want another pair of shoes?

973
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,773
Thank you. I can't miss the last train.

974
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,692
-Hannah, did you get Father's nightshirts?
-Yes, I did.

975
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:38,486
What can I do to help, Beth?

976
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,404
-Thank you for being here.
-Of course.

977
01:11:40,488 --> 01:11:44,951
-Did you find the warm blanket?
-If I may be of any more assistance, please tell me.

978
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,496
-I'll look in on the girls every day without fail.
-Do we need more books or cloth?

979
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:49,497
Thank you.

980
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,416
I've always admired your husband.
I pray for a quick recovery.

981
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,918
I found these linens.

982
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:56,420
-Hannah, medicine?
-The medicine is all packed.

983
01:11:56,504 --> 01:11:59,799
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I came to offer myself as escort to your mother.

984
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,801
Mr. Laurence has commissions in Washington,

985
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:05,012
and it would give me real satisfaction
to be of service to her there.

986
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:08,224
-Thank you.
-Of course.

987
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:13,062
All right, while I'm gone, Hannah is in charge.

988
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:16,941
Remember to check on the Hummels.
It will be a difficult winter for everyone.

989
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:18,526
Will this be enough for the train?

990
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:23,322
Twenty-five dollars?
That's not like Aunt March to be so generous.

991
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:25,449
I didn't go to Aunt March. I couldn't bear to.

992
01:12:25,533 --> 01:12:28,953
-Where'd you get the money?
-I only sold what was my own.

993
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:31,330
Jo! Your hair!

994
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:33,457
-Your one beauty.
-You look like a boy.

995
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,752
Well, it doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail.

996
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:40,256
Oh, I'm so proud you're my daughter.

997
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:44,719
I was crazy to do something for Father.
It'll be good for my vanity anyway.

998
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:46,554
-That could be nice.
-You never do that.

999
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:48,681
-This isn't what I wanted for her.
-Oh, Teddy.

1000
01:12:50,558 --> 01:12:51,475
Oh, Jo.

1001
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,479
My girls, I love you more than words can say.

1002
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:58,691
Be good to each other. Pray for Father's recovery.

1003
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,776
And I'll be back as soon as I can.

1004
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,861
Love you.

1005
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:10,786
Jo.

1006
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:15,541
What is it? Is it Father?

1007
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,501
No.

1008
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:19,795
It's my hair.

1009
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:27,470
I would feel the same way.

1010
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:28,930
I know you would.

1011
01:13:32,683 --> 01:13:34,769
<i>Laurie, when are you going back to your grandfather?</i>

1012
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:36,479
Very soon.

1013
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:41,442
-You've said that a dozen times in the past month.
-Short answers save trouble.

1014
01:13:41,526 --> 01:13:45,238
Well, he is expecting you, so why don't you do it?

1015
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:49,242
-Natural depravity, I suppose.
-Natural indolence, you mean.

1016
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:53,162
I'll only plague him if I go, so I might as well stay
and plague you a little longer.

1017
01:13:53,246 --> 01:13:54,413
You can bear it.

1018
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:57,875
-In fact, I think it agrees with you.
-Stop it. Stop.

1019
01:14:02,463 --> 01:14:04,882
-What are you doing?
-I'm looking at you.

1020
01:14:04,966 --> 01:14:07,802
I mean, what do you intend to do?

1021
01:14:07,885 --> 01:14:08,970
-With life?
-Yes.

1022
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:11,514
I've been writing an opera. I would be the central figure.

1023
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:12,598
That's a waste of time.

1024
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:15,935
What would you have me do?

1025
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:28,823
Go work for your grandfather
and make something of yourself.

1026
01:14:28,906 --> 01:14:31,409
You're not playing fair.

1027
01:14:36,164 --> 01:14:36,998
Here.

1028
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,462
That's-- That's very good.

1029
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:46,924
When did you do this one?

1030
01:14:48,509 --> 01:14:50,303
It was the day at the beach.

1031
01:14:51,596 --> 01:14:53,514
First time I met Fred.

1032
01:14:53,598 --> 01:14:54,765
That's right.

1033
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:01,772
What's he doing?

1034
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:07,487
He's in London on business.

1035
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,946
He'll be back in a few weeks.

1036
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:27,757
Don't marry him.

1037
01:15:29,967 --> 01:15:30,801
What?

1038
01:15:34,347 --> 01:15:35,473
Don't marry him.

1039
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:38,309
Why?

1040
01:15:38,851 --> 01:15:41,062
Why? You know why.

1041
01:15:45,233 --> 01:15:46,067
No.

1042
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:47,527
No.

1043
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,612
-Yes.
-No. Laurie.

1044
01:15:49,695 --> 01:15:51,197
-What?
-You're being mean.

1045
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,907
-Stop it. Stop it.
-What? How am I being mean?

1046
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:57,787
I have been second to Jo my whole life in everything.

1047
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,291
And I will not be the person you settle for
just because you cannot have her.

1048
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,043
I won't. I won't do it.

1049
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:11,092
I won't. Not when I've spent my entire life loving you.

1050
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:28,860
I'm making a mold of my foot for Laurie,
to remind him I have nice feet.

1051
01:16:28,943 --> 01:16:32,613
Mr. Brooke writes
that Father is still very weak but improving.

1052
01:16:34,115 --> 01:16:38,035
Mr. Brooke also says
that Mother is the best nurse a man could ask for.

1053
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:40,788
I wish all the letters were from Mother and not Mr. Brooke.

1054
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:42,123
I'm grateful for any letters.

1055
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:44,876
I think the deep purple is very fitting for Mr. Laurence.

1056
01:16:44,959 --> 01:16:47,795
-Do you agree, Amy?
-Quite. The design is very cunning.

1057
01:16:47,879 --> 01:16:51,549
I had to thank him somehow for allowing me
to play the piano at his house all the time.

1058
01:16:51,632 --> 01:16:54,927
I'm going into town for groceries.
Jo, can you look into getting more firewood?

1059
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:57,180
You all haven't been to the Hummels. We should go.

1060
01:16:57,263 --> 01:17:00,933
Bethy, we barely have enough to feed ourselves.
Besides, I have to finish this story.

1061
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:03,186
-Marmee said--
-Marmee told us to do lots of things,

1062
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:04,729
but we can't possibly do them all.

1063
01:17:04,812 --> 01:17:07,482
I always go by myself.
And you haven't kept up with your tasks.

1064
01:17:07,565 --> 01:17:10,693
-We do. We work.
-Don't worry. We'll find a time.

1065
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:11,694
But it's been weeks.

1066
01:17:11,777 --> 01:17:15,031
-We'll go soon.
-My foot is stuck! I can't get it out!

1067
01:17:15,114 --> 01:17:19,160
Stop it, Jo! I can't get it out! I'm going to lose my foot.

1068
01:17:20,286 --> 01:17:21,579
Fine. I'll go myself.

1069
01:17:25,124 --> 01:17:27,502
Hello. For Mr. Laurence.

1070
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,681
Here she comes.

1071
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:52,527
Beth, look what they got you!

1072
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,987
-Here's a letter from the old gentleman.
-Open the note.

1073
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,865
Oh, Beth, just look.

1074
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:04,664
Jo, read the letter. I cannot.

1075
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:09,836
"Miss Beth March,
I have had many pairs of slippers in my life,

1076
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,256
but I never had any that suited me so well as yours.

1077
01:18:13,339 --> 01:18:16,133
And they will always remind me of the gentle giver.

1078
01:18:16,217 --> 01:18:19,637
I like to pay my debts and hope you will accept this gift.

1079
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,057
Your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence."

1080
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:26,018
-Oh, Beth!
-So sweet. "Your humble servant."

1081
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:28,229
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Look how shiny it is!

1082
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:31,607
-Yes.
-It has gold that goes all the way around the back.

1083
01:18:31,691 --> 01:18:35,319
-His handwriting is beautiful.
-It's got a little drawer here.

1084
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:51,169
Sir, I wanted to thank you for...

1085
01:19:02,597 --> 01:19:04,015
You remind me...

1086
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:07,143
so much of my little girl.

1087
01:19:10,855 --> 01:19:12,315
The piano is yours.

1088
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:15,776
-I should have given it to you long ago.
-Thank you.

1089
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,779
My child...

1090
01:19:20,281 --> 01:19:21,866
you're burning.

1091
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:25,036
The Hummels are very sick.

1092
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:37,131
She's resting.

1093
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:40,384
-How is she? Is there anything I can do?
-What is it?

1094
01:19:40,468 --> 01:19:42,220
-Scarlet fever.
-What's scarlet fever?

1095
01:19:42,303 --> 01:19:44,847
I visited the Hummels. The baby has died.

1096
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:46,682
Have you all had it before?

1097
01:19:46,766 --> 01:19:49,894
-Meg and I have, but Amy hasn't.
-Then she'll have to be sent away.

1098
01:19:49,977 --> 01:19:51,229
I don't want to be sent away.

1099
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:53,773
-See if Aunt March can take her.
-I don't like Aunt March.

1100
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:56,609
-It's for your own good, child.
-Should we send for Mother?

1101
01:19:56,692 --> 01:20:00,446
-No, we shouldn't worry her.
-I've never wished for money more than now.

1102
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,659
Listen, we'll nurse her and she'll get better.

1103
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:05,660
She will.

1104
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,916
"The post office in the forest was a capital little institution

1105
01:20:11,999 --> 01:20:15,419
and flourished wonderfully,
for many things passed through it.

1106
01:20:15,503 --> 01:20:19,215
Poetry and pickles, music and gingerbread,

1107
01:20:19,298 --> 01:20:22,969
invitations, scoldings, and even puppies."

1108
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,764
-It's all about us.
-It is.

1109
01:20:28,307 --> 01:20:30,351
-I love it.
-It's just a little story.

1110
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:33,145
-Nothing like what you usually write.
-You think it's too boring?

1111
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,273
-No, it's my favorite one yet.
-Really?

1112
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:36,774
-Write me another.
-Yes, ma'am.

1113
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:38,192
-Keep writing them.
-I will.

1114
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:39,694
Even when I'm not here.

1115
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:46,450
-Don't say that. Don't say it.
-Jo, I have to tell you.

1116
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:47,535
No, you don't.

1117
01:20:47,618 --> 01:20:50,746
I've had a very long time to think about this, and...

1118
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,540
-And I'm not afraid.
-No.

1119
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:54,250
Nope.

1120
01:20:58,004 --> 01:21:01,799
It's like the tide going out.
It goes out slowly, but it can't be stopped.

1121
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:09,682
I'll stop it.

1122
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,324
I stopped it before.

1123
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:45,885
You will get better, Father will get better,

1124
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:48,137
and we'll all be together soon, all right?

1125
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:50,264
We...

1126
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:55,269
-We can't stop God's will.
-Well, God hasn't met my will yet.

1127
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:57,104
What Jo wills shall be done.

1128
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:15,331
Amy.

1129
01:22:15,414 --> 01:22:16,624
Come here.

1130
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:24,298
Yes?

1131
01:22:24,382 --> 01:22:25,466
Come, sit.

1132
01:22:33,474 --> 01:22:37,311
If you are very good, one day, this ring will belong to you.

1133
01:22:39,981 --> 01:22:42,775
-Really?
-If you keep being a proper young lady,

1134
01:22:42,859 --> 01:22:44,235
just see if it doesn't.

1135
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,242
You are your family's hope now.

1136
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:55,371
Beth is sick, Jo is a lost cause,

1137
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:59,792
and I hear Meg has had her head turned
by a penniless tutor, so...

1138
01:23:01,294 --> 01:23:05,047
it'll be up to you to support them all.

1139
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:09,051
And your indigent parents in their old age.

1140
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,263
So you must marry well.

1141
01:23:16,893 --> 01:23:18,227
Save your family.

1142
01:23:21,772 --> 01:23:24,692
All right, that's all I wanted to say to you.

1143
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:29,780
So you can go back and do your little painting.

1144
01:23:38,206 --> 01:23:39,832
Hello, Aunt March.

1145
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,711
That Laurence boy was just here.

1146
01:23:43,794 --> 01:23:45,004
He was?

1147
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:48,007
What a disappointment he's turned out to be.

1148
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,842
Must be the Italian in him.

1149
01:23:49,926 --> 01:23:52,011
When will he be back?

1150
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:54,555
He's gone.

1151
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:55,598
To London.

1152
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,434
Why?

1153
01:24:00,061 --> 01:24:02,271
What do you need to discuss with him?

1154
01:24:16,536 --> 01:24:20,122
I... I just told Fred Vaughn I wouldn't marry him.

1155
01:24:44,397 --> 01:24:45,231
Meg.

1156
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:54,407
<i>I'll come home to help with the children. Sorry.</i>

1157
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:57,076
-I just-- I'm so worried for Beth.
-Stay.

1158
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,454
-I asked for leave. I will take care of the children.
-Oh, John.

1159
01:25:03,374 --> 01:25:04,417
There's one other thing.

1160
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,211
You should send your fabric
to the dressmaker as soon as possible.

1161
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:09,380
-I can't.
-I don't want to hear another word.

1162
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:11,007
I want you to have that dress.

1163
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:13,467
My old coat will be fine for the winter.

1164
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:14,760
-John, I--
-It's all settled.

1165
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:16,429
John, I really can't.

1166
01:25:17,138 --> 01:25:19,140
I sold the fabric to Sallie.

1167
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,351
You did?

1168
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,023
I don't want you to be unhappy.

1169
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:29,233
I couldn't be.

1170
01:25:29,317 --> 01:25:32,904
John Brooke is my husband.

1171
01:25:32,987 --> 01:25:34,447
And I am his wife.

1172
01:25:41,954 --> 01:25:44,582
Hannah! It's all right. It's all right.

1173
01:25:49,253 --> 01:25:50,087
What do we do?

1174
01:25:52,673 --> 01:25:54,509
We should send for your mother.

1175
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,275
-Marmee!
-Bless you.

1176
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:13,402
She's worse. I didn't know what else to do.

1177
01:26:13,486 --> 01:26:15,488
-Jo, how is she?
-My girls.

1178
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:16,656
My sweet Beth.

1179
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:20,117
Hannah, make a clear broth.
Jo, get ice. We need to cool you.

1180
01:26:21,869 --> 01:26:23,496
Who's with Father?

1181
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:24,956
John stayed with him.

1182
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:26,874
We need to change the linens.

1183
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:29,460
We're going to move you, sweet girl.

1184
01:26:29,544 --> 01:26:30,753
-Oh, look at her.
-That's it.

1185
01:26:30,837 --> 01:26:32,004
Hold on. It's okay.

1186
01:26:34,298 --> 01:26:35,716
I know.

1187
01:27:25,683 --> 01:27:26,934
Please fight.

1188
01:27:33,274 --> 01:27:35,526
Don't go quietly.

1189
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:36,569
Fight.

1190
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:41,199
Please, please, just fight to the end and be loud,

1191
01:27:41,282 --> 01:27:43,701
and don't just quietly go away, Beth.

1192
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:07,892
Marmee?

1193
01:28:11,062 --> 01:28:12,021
Marmee?

1194
01:28:12,814 --> 01:28:13,648
Marmee?

1195
01:28:18,986 --> 01:28:19,987
Jo.

1196
01:28:27,453 --> 01:28:28,913
Merry Christmas, Beth.

1197
01:28:28,996 --> 01:28:30,790
Popcorn. Make sure that it's in the middle.

1198
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,500
-I know.
-You're doing the sides first,

1199
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:36,212
and they aren't spaced for my popcorn
because I'm making a popcorn garland.

1200
01:28:36,921 --> 01:28:39,632
And you're wasting decorations,
and they're not dangling right.

1201
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:42,802
The sides are the most important thing.
If you don't have the sides...

1202
01:28:42,885 --> 01:28:45,555
Here's another Christmas gift for the March family.

1203
01:28:46,681 --> 01:28:48,975
-Oh, my God! Father!
-Father!

1204
01:28:49,475 --> 01:28:50,351
Father!

1205
01:28:54,063 --> 01:28:55,481
My little women.

1206
01:28:57,441 --> 01:28:58,860
How you've grown.

1207
01:29:00,153 --> 01:29:01,404
Oh, Beth.

1208
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:03,948
Merry Christmas, my dear.

1209
01:29:04,031 --> 01:29:07,034
-Merry Christmas to each of you.
-Merry Christmas, Father.

1210
01:29:07,118 --> 01:29:08,244
Merry Christmas.

1211
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:12,748
Oh, thank God.

1212
01:29:12,832 --> 01:29:15,209
-Thank God you're home.
-Thank God for you.

1213
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:18,337
Now I can be angry with you in person.

1214
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:29,635
I can't believe today is my wedding day.

1215
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:33,264
What's wrong?

1216
01:31:34,265 --> 01:31:35,099
Nothing.

1217
01:31:36,392 --> 01:31:37,226
Jo.

1218
01:31:40,688 --> 01:31:43,024
We can leave. We can leave right now.

1219
01:31:43,107 --> 01:31:45,234
I can make money. I'll sell stories.

1220
01:31:45,318 --> 01:31:49,822
I'll do anything. I'll cook. I'll clean.
I'll work in a factory. I can make a life for us.

1221
01:31:49,906 --> 01:31:51,991
-Jo--
-And you should be an actress,

1222
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:54,076
and you should have a life on the stage.

1223
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,786
Let's just run away together.

1224
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:58,414
-I want to get married.
-Oh, why?

1225
01:31:58,498 --> 01:32:00,041
Because I love him.

1226
01:32:00,124 --> 01:32:03,211
You will be bored of him in two years,

1227
01:32:03,294 --> 01:32:05,254
and we'll be interesting forever.

1228
01:32:05,338 --> 01:32:08,966
Just because my dreams are different than yours
doesn't mean they're unimportant.

1229
01:32:11,344 --> 01:32:12,595
I want a home.

1230
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:17,058
And a family. And I'm willing to work and struggle.

1231
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:19,644
But I want to do it with John.

1232
01:32:24,982 --> 01:32:26,943
I just hate that you're leaving me.

1233
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:29,737
Don't leave.

1234
01:32:29,821 --> 01:32:30,905
Oh, Jo.

1235
01:32:34,075 --> 01:32:35,701
I'm not leaving you.

1236
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:37,870
And besides...

1237
01:32:40,206 --> 01:32:42,208
one day, it will be your turn.

1238
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:52,051
I'd rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe.

1239
01:32:53,594 --> 01:32:54,470
I would.

1240
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:02,728
Can't believe childhood is over.

1241
01:33:04,897 --> 01:33:07,984
It was going to end one way or another.

1242
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:09,527
And what a happy end.

1243
01:33:12,113 --> 01:33:14,323
What excessive promises...

1244
01:33:14,407 --> 01:33:17,869
giving yourself away to get the other.

1245
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,495
What a gift.

1246
01:33:19,579 --> 01:33:24,876
Always given before is known the cost or the reward.

1247
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:26,669
I pronounce you man and wife.

1248
01:33:27,837 --> 01:33:29,297
You may kiss the bride.

1249
01:34:07,043 --> 01:34:08,628
<i>Oh, don't have to make a fuss.</i>

1250
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:10,880
You don't need to see me to the carriage.

1251
01:34:10,963 --> 01:34:12,173
Oh, I'm happy to.

1252
01:34:12,256 --> 01:34:14,509
I hope you will be happy now...

1253
01:34:15,092 --> 01:34:19,430
that you've ruined your life the same way
your mother did by marrying your father.

1254
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:22,183
My dear sister, you're too kind.

1255
01:34:22,266 --> 01:34:25,311
-And thank you for today's festivities.
-You're most welcome.

1256
01:34:25,394 --> 01:34:26,771
Thank you, Aunt March.

1257
01:34:26,854 --> 01:34:30,233
Oh, I don't like to be kissed.

1258
01:34:30,316 --> 01:34:32,068
Oh, I'm sorry.

1259
01:34:32,151 --> 01:34:35,988
You will be sorry when you've tried love in a cottage
and found it a failure.

1260
01:34:36,072 --> 01:34:39,033
It can't be worse than some people find in big houses.

1261
01:34:39,116 --> 01:34:42,328
Oh, I quite understand your meaning, missus.

1262
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:44,956
I don't miss a thing.

1263
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:46,874
We know this.

1264
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:49,961
And you're not entirely wrong.

1265
01:34:50,044 --> 01:34:53,381
I may not always be right, but I'm never wrong.

1266
01:34:55,132 --> 01:34:59,220
And here is the only sane member of the family.

1267
01:34:59,303 --> 01:35:01,180
I really can't take any more of this.

1268
01:35:01,264 --> 01:35:02,890
-I know.
-You can imagine.

1269
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:14,318
Marmee! Marmee! Marmee, Marmee, Marmee!

1270
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:16,404
-What?
-Aunt March is going to Europe.

1271
01:35:16,487 --> 01:35:18,281
Oh, and she wants me to go with her!

1272
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:20,491
That's wonderful!

1273
01:35:20,575 --> 01:35:23,327
Now I know why I spent
all those boring hours reading to her.

1274
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:24,954
No, no, she wants me to go.

1275
01:35:26,455 --> 01:35:28,374
As her companion.

1276
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:30,334
Europe, with you?

1277
01:35:30,418 --> 01:35:33,629
Yes, she wants me to work on my art
and my French, of course.

1278
01:35:34,255 --> 01:35:36,424
You don't really like French though, do you?

1279
01:35:39,093 --> 01:35:40,553
That's wonderful, Amy.

1280
01:35:43,014 --> 01:35:45,349
Father! I'm going to Europe!

1281
01:36:17,173 --> 01:36:18,674
Meg married.

1282
01:36:18,758 --> 01:36:20,885
Amy off to Europe.

1283
01:36:20,968 --> 01:36:23,971
And now that you're a graduate,
you'll be off on a long holiday.

1284
01:36:25,806 --> 01:36:29,018
I'm just not good like Beth, so I'm angry and restless.

1285
01:36:29,101 --> 01:36:31,771
You don't have to stay here, Jo.

1286
01:36:31,854 --> 01:36:34,190
Why? Should we run off and join a pirate ship?

1287
01:36:40,363 --> 01:36:42,406
-No. No.
-It's no use, Jo.

1288
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:43,783
-Don't.
-We got to have it out.

1289
01:36:43,866 --> 01:36:44,951
-No.
-I have loved you

1290
01:36:45,034 --> 01:36:47,453
ever since I've known you, Jo. I couldn't help it.

1291
01:36:47,537 --> 01:36:49,997
-I tried to show and you wouldn't let me.
-No.

1292
01:36:50,081 --> 01:36:54,460
But I must make you hear now and give me an answer
because I cannot go on like this!

1293
01:36:54,544 --> 01:36:56,087
-Please don't.
-I gave up billiards.

1294
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:58,464
I gave up everything you didn't like. I'm happy I did.

1295
01:36:58,548 --> 01:37:02,093
It's fine, and I waited, and I never complained because I...

1296
01:37:03,553 --> 01:37:05,805
You know, I figured you'd love me, Jo.

1297
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:08,975
And I realize I'm not half good enough

1298
01:37:09,058 --> 01:37:11,227
-and I'm not this great man--
-No! Yes, you are.

1299
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:12,937
You're a great deal too good for me.

1300
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:16,899
And I'm so grateful to you,
and I'm so proud of you, and I just--

1301
01:37:16,983 --> 01:37:20,111
I don't see why I can't love you as you want me to.

1302
01:37:20,194 --> 01:37:21,404
I don't know why.

1303
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,364
You can't?

1304
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:25,658
No. I can't.

1305
01:37:25,741 --> 01:37:27,910
I can't change how I feel, and...

1306
01:37:29,829 --> 01:37:32,373
it would be a lie to say I do when I don't.

1307
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:35,209
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

1308
01:37:36,252 --> 01:37:39,046
I'm so sorry, but I just can't help it.

1309
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,591
I can't love anyone else, Jo. I only love you.

1310
01:37:41,674 --> 01:37:43,259
It would be a disaster if we married.

1311
01:37:43,342 --> 01:37:45,136
-It wouldn't be.
-We'd be miserable.

1312
01:37:45,219 --> 01:37:47,221
-Jo, I'd be a perfect saint.
-I can't! I can't!

1313
01:37:47,305 --> 01:37:50,016
-I've tried it and I failed. I can't.
-Why does everyone expect it, then?

1314
01:37:50,099 --> 01:37:54,228
Why does your family and my grandpa expect it?
Why are you saying this? Say yes.

1315
01:37:54,312 --> 01:37:59,233
-Let's be happy together, Jo!
-I can't say yes truly, so I'm not going to say it at all.

1316
01:37:59,317 --> 01:38:01,611
You'll see that I'm right eventually,

1317
01:38:01,694 --> 01:38:03,321
and you'll thank me for it.

1318
01:38:07,617 --> 01:38:09,535
I'd rather hang myself than realize this, Jo.

1319
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:11,496
-Teddy.
-I would rather be dead.

1320
01:38:11,996 --> 01:38:13,414
Teddy, don't say that.

1321
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:15,541
Teddy.

1322
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:21,214
Listen, you'll find some lovely, accomplished girl

1323
01:38:21,297 --> 01:38:23,966
who will love you and adore you,

1324
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:27,762
and she's gonna make a fine mistress
for your fine house, but I wouldn't.

1325
01:38:27,845 --> 01:38:29,263
-Yes, you would, Jo.
-Look at me.

1326
01:38:29,347 --> 01:38:32,308
-I'm homely, and I'm awkward, and I'm odd.
-I love you, Jo.

1327
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:34,477
-And you'd be ashamed of me.
-I love you, Jo.

1328
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,355
And we would quarrel because we can't help it even now.

1329
01:38:40,107 --> 01:38:44,737
I'd hate elegant society, you'd hate my scribbling,
and we would be unhappy.

1330
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:47,740
And we'd wish we hadn't done it,
and everything will be horrid.

1331
01:38:50,868 --> 01:38:52,245
Is there anything more?

1332
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:55,289
-No, nothing more.
-All right.

1333
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,291
Except that...

1334
01:39:01,712 --> 01:39:04,131
Teddy, I don't believe I will ever marry.

1335
01:39:05,466 --> 01:39:07,176
I'm happy as I am,

1336
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:10,054
and I love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up.

1337
01:39:10,137 --> 01:39:11,597
-I think you're wrong, Jo.
-No.

1338
01:39:11,681 --> 01:39:14,433
I think you will marry.
I think you'll find someone and love them.

1339
01:39:14,517 --> 01:39:17,562
And you will live and die for them
because that's your way, and you will.

1340
01:39:21,107 --> 01:39:22,316
And I'll watch.

1341
01:40:01,606 --> 01:40:03,399
I don't want to disturb your writing.

1342
01:40:04,442 --> 01:40:05,860
I don't do that anymore.

1343
01:40:08,196 --> 01:40:09,405
It didn't save her.

1344
01:40:26,297 --> 01:40:28,341
You're much too lonely here, Jo.

1345
01:40:30,218 --> 01:40:34,680
Wouldn't you like to go back to New York?
What about your friend Friedrich?

1346
01:40:34,764 --> 01:40:36,182
-Wasn't that his name?
-No.

1347
01:40:37,892 --> 01:40:41,729
I ruined our friendship with my temper,
just as I ruin everything.

1348
01:40:41,812 --> 01:40:43,272
I'm sure I'll never see him again.

1349
01:40:43,356 --> 01:40:46,192
I doubt that a sincere friend would be deterred.

1350
01:40:48,486 --> 01:40:49,821
I wish that were true.

1351
01:40:53,533 --> 01:40:56,661
If I was a girl in a book, this would all be so easy.

1352
01:40:59,038 --> 01:41:00,873
Just give up the world happily.

1353
01:41:05,169 --> 01:41:06,796
Laurie's returning, you know.

1354
01:41:07,672 --> 01:41:09,340
Oh, he is?

1355
01:41:09,423 --> 01:41:12,260
There was a letter from Amy. She's coming home.

1356
01:41:12,343 --> 01:41:15,221
She's devastated about Beth.

1357
01:41:15,304 --> 01:41:19,433
Aunt March is very ill, so Laurie will accompany them.

1358
01:41:22,603 --> 01:41:23,813
That's good of him.

1359
01:41:29,527 --> 01:41:31,612
-What is it?
-I don't know.

1360
01:41:31,696 --> 01:41:34,073
I've always been quite content with my family.

1361
01:41:36,909 --> 01:41:38,327
Don't understand it.

1362
01:41:40,663 --> 01:41:42,623
Perhaps...

1363
01:41:42,707 --> 01:41:45,168
Perhaps I...

1364
01:41:45,251 --> 01:41:47,587
was too quick in turning him down.

1365
01:41:48,838 --> 01:41:49,714
Laurie.

1366
01:41:52,383 --> 01:41:53,676
Do you love him?

1367
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:00,141
If he asked me again, I think I would say yes.

1368
01:42:01,517 --> 01:42:03,060
Do you think he'll ask me again?

1369
01:42:04,228 --> 01:42:05,605
But do you love him?

1370
01:42:07,732 --> 01:42:09,817
I care more to be loved.

1371
01:42:10,776 --> 01:42:12,069
I want to be loved.

1372
01:42:13,154 --> 01:42:15,490
That is not the same as loving.

1373
01:42:19,952 --> 01:42:20,786
I know.

1374
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:26,667
You know, I just-- I just feel...

1375
01:42:26,751 --> 01:42:28,419
I just feel like...

1376
01:42:29,879 --> 01:42:31,672
women, they...

1377
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:38,387
They have minds and they have souls, as well as just hearts.

1378
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:42,225
And they've got ambition and they've got talent,
as well as just beauty.

1379
01:42:42,308 --> 01:42:47,522
And I'm so sick of people saying
that love is just all a woman is fit for.

1380
01:42:47,605 --> 01:42:49,106
I'm so sick of it.

1381
01:42:50,733 --> 01:42:53,653
But I'm-- I'm so lonely.

1382
01:43:36,612 --> 01:43:39,866
Couldn't let you travel alone with Aunt March being so sick.

1383
01:43:41,534 --> 01:43:43,286
Even if you despise me.

1384
01:43:44,871 --> 01:43:46,664
I don't despise you, Laurie.

1385
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:56,048
Beth was the best of us.

1386
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:10,730
I'm not marrying Fred.

1387
01:44:14,484 --> 01:44:16,110
I heard about that.

1388
01:44:16,194 --> 01:44:20,990
And you are under no obligation
to say anything or do anything.

1389
01:44:24,202 --> 01:44:26,496
I just didn't love him as I should.

1390
01:44:28,498 --> 01:44:31,751
So we don't need to talk about it.
We don't need to say anything.

1391
01:44:47,934 --> 01:44:49,894
<i>My dear Teddy,</i>

1392
01:44:49,977 --> 01:44:52,188
<i>I miss you more than I can express.</i>

1393
01:44:52,939 --> 01:44:56,275
<i>I used to think that the worst fate was to be a wife.</i>

1394
01:44:57,485 --> 01:44:59,487
<i>I was young and stupid.</i>

1395
01:45:00,738 --> 01:45:02,615
<i>But now I have changed.</i>

1396
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:05,785
<i>The worst fate is to live my life without you in it.</i>

1397
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:10,414
<i>I was wrong to turn you down and run away to New York.</i>

1398
01:45:16,879 --> 01:45:18,172
Oysters!

1399
01:45:22,885 --> 01:45:24,262
Lobsters!

1400
01:45:36,607 --> 01:45:37,692
<i>Jo.</i>

1401
01:45:38,693 --> 01:45:40,528
<i>Jo. Jo.</i>

1402
01:45:42,029 --> 01:45:42,864
Jo.

1403
01:45:44,157 --> 01:45:45,074
Wake up.

1404
01:45:45,867 --> 01:45:46,868
Wake up.

1405
01:45:50,413 --> 01:45:54,292
-Teddy! Oh, you're back.
-Are you glad to see me, then?

1406
01:45:55,334 --> 01:45:56,460
Yes.

1407
01:45:56,919 --> 01:45:58,629
Oh, I was worried.

1408
01:46:00,339 --> 01:46:01,340
Here, come sit.

1409
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:10,766
How's Amy? Did she bother you all the way
from Europe with her preening?

1410
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:13,102
Yes, but I like that.

1411
01:46:13,186 --> 01:46:14,687
Where is she? Did she not come home?

1412
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:17,356
Your mother has her down at Meg's.
We stopped on the way.

1413
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,650
There was no getting my wife out of their clutches.

1414
01:46:21,986 --> 01:46:23,404
Your what?

1415
01:46:23,488 --> 01:46:27,325
I've done it now. It was meant to be a surprise.

1416
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,702
We were engaged and we were hoping to wait,

1417
01:46:29,785 --> 01:46:32,914
but that is to say that now we are man and wife.

1418
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:37,210
You and Amy?

1419
01:46:37,293 --> 01:46:38,127
Yes.

1420
01:46:49,931 --> 01:46:51,307
Are you in love?

1421
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,308
Yes.

1422
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:58,439
Jo, I want to say one thing and then we'll put it away forever.

1423
01:46:58,523 --> 01:47:00,733
I've always loved you.

1424
01:47:00,817 --> 01:47:02,693
But the love I feel for Amy, it's different.

1425
01:47:03,194 --> 01:47:04,195
And I think...

1426
01:47:05,071 --> 01:47:07,824
you were right about this.
I think we would've killed each other.

1427
01:47:10,618 --> 01:47:11,661
Yes.

1428
01:47:12,245 --> 01:47:13,913
I think it was meant this way.

1429
01:47:15,873 --> 01:47:17,083
Oh, Teddy.

1430
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,585
You're the only one that ever calls me that, Jo.

1431
01:47:19,669 --> 01:47:20,670
"Teddy."

1432
01:47:22,088 --> 01:47:23,673
What does Amy call you?

1433
01:47:23,756 --> 01:47:25,758
"My lord."

1434
01:47:25,842 --> 01:47:27,718
That sounds like her.

1435
01:47:31,764 --> 01:47:33,724
Well, you look deserving of it.

1436
01:47:36,477 --> 01:47:38,980
Could we still be friends, Jo, please?

1437
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:44,902
Of course, my boy. Always.

1438
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:57,123
She's a painter.

1439
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,417
Are you excited?

1440
01:48:09,969 --> 01:48:10,970
Laurie told you?

1441
01:48:11,053 --> 01:48:12,513
Yes, yes.

1442
01:48:14,015 --> 01:48:16,017
Amy, I'm so happy for you.

1443
01:48:16,434 --> 01:48:18,311
This-- This was meant to be.

1444
01:48:18,394 --> 01:48:20,396
Oh, I'm so relieved. Thank you.

1445
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:22,398
I wanted to write, Jo. I wanted to write.

1446
01:48:22,482 --> 01:48:25,026
And I wanted to explain,
but everything was happening so fast

1447
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:27,445
and I was worried you'd be angry at me.

1448
01:48:27,528 --> 01:48:30,239
-No. No.
-No, you're not angry at me?

1449
01:48:31,991 --> 01:48:34,368
Life is too short to be angry at one's sisters.

1450
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:41,876
I really miss her.

1451
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:43,127
I know.

1452
01:48:47,048 --> 01:48:48,049
Thank you.

1453
01:49:46,983 --> 01:49:48,276
Mr. Laurence.

1454
01:49:51,154 --> 01:49:52,071
Jo.

1455
01:49:54,323 --> 01:49:55,575
Oh, Jo.

1456
01:49:58,035 --> 01:50:00,913
I couldn't bring myself to...

1457
01:50:05,334 --> 01:50:08,963
The house doesn't seem right without her, and...

1458
01:50:10,882 --> 01:50:13,342
Couldn't go in, knowing she wouldn't be there.

1459
01:50:20,766 --> 01:50:23,186
I know I'm not half so good as my sister,

1460
01:50:23,728 --> 01:50:27,231
but you know I'll be a friend to lean on, if you'll let me.

1461
01:50:35,031 --> 01:50:35,948
All right.

1462
01:54:01,863 --> 01:54:03,739
<i>Dear Mr. Dashwood,</i>

1463
01:54:03,823 --> 01:54:08,244
enclosed are the first few chapters
of a piece I've only begun working on.

1464
01:54:08,327 --> 01:54:12,039
It could suit as a story for young people,
but I think it is probably quite boring.

1465
01:54:12,748 --> 01:54:17,170
<i>However, I'm sending it to you
just in case it has something of value, though I doubt it.</i>

1466
01:54:17,253 --> 01:54:18,462
<i>Jo March.</i>

1467
01:54:37,773 --> 01:54:39,525
I thought she hated me.

1468
01:54:39,609 --> 01:54:42,028
She could still hate you and leave you the house.

1469
01:54:42,111 --> 01:54:43,905
What about you and John?

1470
01:54:43,988 --> 01:54:47,200
We can't manage a grand house like this. It's too big.

1471
01:54:55,625 --> 01:55:00,755
I should sell it, but I'd love to do something
that would really make Aunt March turn in her grave.

1472
01:55:00,838 --> 01:55:02,840
-I wouldn't mind that.
-A nice turning.

1473
01:55:02,924 --> 01:55:04,800
Just a rotation, nothing terrible.

1474
01:55:05,176 --> 01:55:06,427
What will you do?

1475
01:55:08,387 --> 01:55:10,473
I'd like to open a school.

1476
01:55:10,556 --> 01:55:13,601
We never had a proper school,
and now there are women's colleges opening.

1477
01:55:13,684 --> 01:55:15,895
There should be a school. For Daisy.

1478
01:55:15,978 --> 01:55:19,106
-And what will Demi do?
-I'll open a school for boys and girls both.

1479
01:55:20,107 --> 01:55:21,234
What about writing?

1480
01:55:22,485 --> 01:55:25,071
-What about it?
-What are you working on?

1481
01:55:25,154 --> 01:55:28,282
I started something, but I don't think it's very good.

1482
01:55:28,366 --> 01:55:31,327
-Everyone likes what you write.
-No, they don't.

1483
01:55:31,410 --> 01:55:32,912
I do.

1484
01:55:32,995 --> 01:55:35,206
Well, it's just about our little life.

1485
01:55:35,289 --> 01:55:36,457
So?

1486
01:55:36,541 --> 01:55:39,001
Well, who will be interested in a story

1487
01:55:39,085 --> 01:55:40,962
of domestic struggles and joys?

1488
01:55:41,045 --> 01:55:42,880
It doesn't have any real importance.

1489
01:55:42,964 --> 01:55:46,175
Maybe it doesn't seem important
because people don't write about them.

1490
01:55:46,259 --> 01:55:49,929
No, writing doesn't confer importance. It reflects it.

1491
01:55:51,222 --> 01:55:53,015
I don't think so.

1492
01:55:53,099 --> 01:55:55,184
Writing them will make them more important.

1493
01:55:57,019 --> 01:55:59,146
When did you become so wise?

1494
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:02,066
I always have been.
You were just too busy noticing my faults.

1495
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:03,985
Which were never there, of course.

1496
01:56:20,501 --> 01:56:21,961
<i>Dear Miss March,</i>

1497
01:56:22,044 --> 01:56:26,716
I read the chapters you sent
and I have to agree, they aren't very promising.

1498
01:56:26,799 --> 01:56:31,470
<i>But, please, send more stories
of the scandalous variety, if you have any.</i>

1499
01:56:31,846 --> 01:56:34,098
Or, shall I say, your friend can.

1500
01:56:35,224 --> 01:56:37,602
My apologies for the joke.

1501
01:56:37,685 --> 01:56:38,686
I couldn't help it.

1502
01:56:39,228 --> 01:56:40,688
Jo, come down!

1503
01:56:41,814 --> 01:56:42,732
Coming!

1504
01:56:45,443 --> 01:56:46,903
I'm starving.

1505
01:56:49,697 --> 01:56:51,908
-Jo, you might wanna wait because--
-I'm famished.

1506
01:56:51,991 --> 01:56:54,243
But, Jo, dear, you have a guest.

1507
01:56:54,327 --> 01:56:55,953
I don't know anyone.

1508
01:56:56,037 --> 01:56:58,664
I'm sorry to intrude, but...

1509
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:01,959
It's you.

1510
01:57:15,598 --> 01:57:16,724
Hello.

1511
01:57:17,475 --> 01:57:19,602
Hello. I'm Josephine March.

1512
01:57:19,685 --> 01:57:21,395
-I'm Jo.
-Josephine, is that you?

1513
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:25,149
Welcome! Welcome. This is Kitty and Minnie.

1514
01:57:25,233 --> 01:57:30,613
And I see that you have already met our professor.
And he's a very accomplished man.

1515
01:57:30,696 --> 01:57:32,782
And your mother says that you are a writer.

1516
01:57:32,865 --> 01:57:34,450
I keep a diary, you know.

1517
01:57:34,534 --> 01:57:38,996
We have a lot of interesting people here,
intellectuals and Europeans...

1518
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:42,542
Jo, I hope it is all right. I got your address from Ms. Kirke.

1519
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:44,210
Who's this? Who are you?

1520
01:57:44,293 --> 01:57:48,756
I'm so sorry to intrude. I was close by, and I thought I'd...

1521
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,925
-But I'll be going.
-No, no.

1522
01:57:51,008 --> 01:57:52,885
Please stay. We have more than enough room.

1523
01:57:52,969 --> 01:57:54,595
Can someone tell me who this man is?

1524
01:57:54,679 --> 01:57:55,972
I don't want to be a burden.

1525
01:57:56,055 --> 01:57:57,390
Oh, you're not a burden at all.

1526
01:57:57,473 --> 01:57:59,100
-Yes, of course. Please.
- I'm Laurie.

1527
01:57:59,183 --> 01:58:01,394
-Who are you?
-I'm Friedrich Bhaer.

1528
01:58:01,477 --> 01:58:03,980
We were at the same boardinghouse together in New York.

1529
01:58:04,063 --> 01:58:06,983
Oh, Jo, he's very handsome.

1530
01:58:16,242 --> 01:58:18,077
Do you intend to stay in New York?

1531
01:58:18,161 --> 01:58:21,497
No. I've been offered a professorship in California.

1532
01:58:22,498 --> 01:58:26,460
And, as I have nothing keeping me here,

1533
01:58:26,544 --> 01:58:29,046
I thought I might go west.

1534
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:32,925
It is new there, and they are less particular about immigrants.

1535
01:58:33,426 --> 01:58:35,428
Perhaps I should go west.

1536
01:58:35,511 --> 01:58:38,931
You're not an immigrant, so perhaps you should stay home.

1537
01:58:42,518 --> 01:58:43,853
I'm going!

1538
01:58:52,904 --> 01:58:53,946
Jo!

1539
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:56,240
-Joseph, not Josephine.
-I know Joseph.

1540
01:58:56,324 --> 01:58:57,658
Pretty well, actually.

1541
01:58:59,869 --> 01:59:02,622
This is a beautiful instrument.

1542
01:59:02,705 --> 01:59:04,123
Which one of you plays?

1543
01:59:04,207 --> 01:59:06,584
Oh, it was my sister Beth.

1544
01:59:06,667 --> 01:59:08,711
We all play a little, but...

1545
01:59:08,794 --> 01:59:10,505
But none so well as her.

1546
01:59:10,588 --> 01:59:12,715
It is very hard to lose a sister.

1547
01:59:13,799 --> 01:59:14,842
I'm sorry.

1548
01:59:16,802 --> 01:59:19,639
-Do you play?
-Yes. I do.

1549
01:59:19,722 --> 01:59:22,308
It would make us so happy if you'd play now.

1550
01:59:22,391 --> 01:59:24,560
She wouldn't want the piano to sit silent.

1551
01:59:26,062 --> 01:59:27,522
I don't wish to offend.

1552
01:59:27,605 --> 01:59:29,190
Not in the least.

1553
01:59:56,884 --> 02:00:00,137
-It was so lovely to meet you.
-Lovely to meet you. Goodbye.

1554
02:00:00,221 --> 02:00:01,889
It was a real pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.

1555
02:00:01,973 --> 02:00:03,724
-Bye, Laurie.
-Goodbye.

1556
02:00:06,102 --> 02:00:08,521
-Thank you for everything.
-Lovely to have you.

1557
02:00:08,604 --> 02:00:13,609
If you ever come to California, I would love to see you.

1558
02:00:15,486 --> 02:00:18,030
I don't know that I will, but thank you.

1559
02:00:22,076 --> 02:00:24,537
Well, goodbye.

1560
02:00:27,081 --> 02:00:27,957
Goodbye.

1561
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:43,598
What?

1562
02:00:44,599 --> 02:00:46,309
Why are you all looking at me like that?

1563
02:00:46,392 --> 02:00:48,686
What a wonderful man. I hope he comes back.

1564
02:00:48,769 --> 02:00:50,605
He would make a terrific friend for me.

1565
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:53,191
-Oh, Father, he wasn't here for you!
-No?

1566
02:00:53,274 --> 02:00:55,610
-Jo, you love him.
-What?!

1567
02:00:55,693 --> 02:00:57,528
-No, no, I don't.
-Yes, you do!

1568
02:00:57,612 --> 02:01:01,491
I am half as smart as you,
but I can see it so plainly. You love him.

1569
02:01:01,574 --> 02:01:03,743
-Doesn't she love him?
-Good instinct. You love him.

1570
02:01:03,826 --> 02:01:06,787
I have never seen you so happy. What else is love?

1571
02:01:06,871 --> 02:01:10,333
You need to go after him.
Laurie, prepare the horses. We can catch him.

1572
02:01:10,416 --> 02:01:12,335
-I'm coming too.
-No, I'm not going.

1573
02:01:12,418 --> 02:01:14,795
-Yes, you are. Amy is right.
-Exactly!

1574
02:01:14,879 --> 02:01:18,299
Never thought I'd prepare a carriage
to help Jo March chase a man, but I like it.

1575
02:01:18,382 --> 02:01:20,134
-He's moving to California.
-That was fiction!

1576
02:01:20,218 --> 02:01:23,721
-He was practically begging for a reason to stay.
-But it's raining outside.

1577
02:01:23,804 --> 02:01:25,723
That doesn't matter. Can you come with me?

1578
02:01:25,806 --> 02:01:27,308
-I need to fix you.
-Jo.

1579
02:01:27,391 --> 02:01:31,395
Laurie, will you stop standing there
and go get the horses ready? Thank you.

1580
02:01:38,152 --> 02:01:42,615
You never ask about my mother,
even when you know I've seen her.

1581
02:01:42,698 --> 02:01:44,784
I assume she's still alive.

1582
02:01:44,867 --> 02:01:46,577
But I ask after your mother.

1583
02:01:46,661 --> 02:01:48,704
And I have no idea why.

1584
02:01:48,788 --> 02:01:50,498
You're willfully missing the point.

1585
02:01:50,581 --> 02:01:51,999
That's true.

1586
02:01:52,083 --> 02:01:55,378
-What is that--? What do they want?
-I have no idea.

1587
02:01:56,212 --> 02:01:58,589
-Father, are you publishing this?
-What happened to the "little women"?

1588
02:01:58,673 --> 02:02:00,424
Tell me you have the rest of this book.

1589
02:02:01,425 --> 02:02:02,260
What?

1590
02:02:16,524 --> 02:02:18,693
I'm just trying to fix this hair.

1591
02:02:23,322 --> 02:02:25,324
Stop, stop, stop. Stop the carriage.

1592
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,909
-Wait, stop!
-Stop the carriage!

1593
02:02:26,993 --> 02:02:29,829
-Stop. All right, Go. Out. Out.
-Go. Go, go, go.

1594
02:02:29,912 --> 02:02:31,122
-Go!
-Jo, your hair!

1595
02:02:31,205 --> 02:02:32,832
Kiss him with love!

1596
02:02:41,841 --> 02:02:45,553
Frankly, I don't see why she didn't marry the neighbor.

1597
02:02:45,636 --> 02:02:47,680
Well, because the neighbor marries her sister.

1598
02:02:49,223 --> 02:02:51,851
Right, right. Of course.

1599
02:02:53,895 --> 02:02:56,189
-So who does she marry?
-No one.

1600
02:02:56,564 --> 02:02:58,107
She doesn't marry either of them.

1601
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:00,026
No.

1602
02:03:01,402 --> 02:03:04,363
No! No, no, that won't work at all.

1603
02:03:04,447 --> 02:03:06,282
She says the whole book that she doesn't want to marry.

1604
02:03:06,365 --> 02:03:08,075
Who cares?

1605
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:12,038
-Girls want to see women married, not consistent.
-No, it isn't the right ending.

1606
02:03:12,121 --> 02:03:14,290
The right ending is the one that sells.

1607
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:16,417
Trust me.

1608
02:03:16,501 --> 02:03:20,713
If you decide to end your delightful book
with your heroine a spinster,

1609
02:03:20,796 --> 02:03:22,465
no one will buy it.

1610
02:03:22,548 --> 02:03:24,383
It won't be worth printing.

1611
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:29,555
I suppose marriage has always been
an economic proposition, even in fiction.

1612
02:03:29,972 --> 02:03:31,057
It's romance.

1613
02:03:31,516 --> 02:03:34,143
-It's mercenary.
-Just end it that way, will you?

1614
02:03:35,269 --> 02:03:36,187
Fine.

1615
02:03:36,270 --> 02:03:37,563
-Go!
-Jo, your hair!

1616
02:03:37,647 --> 02:03:39,357
-Kiss him with love!
-Go!

1617
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:44,987
-You look so beautiful!
-Go, Jo!

1618
02:04:03,756 --> 02:04:04,590
Jo!

1619
02:04:12,598 --> 02:04:15,351
I-- I don't want you to leave. I want you to stay.

1620
02:04:15,434 --> 02:04:16,727
-You do?
-Yes.

1621
02:04:16,811 --> 02:04:18,688
I would never leave if you wish me to stay.

1622
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:21,440
-No, I want you to stay.
-I have nothing to give you, Jo.

1623
02:04:21,524 --> 02:04:22,984
It doesn't matter.

1624
02:04:23,067 --> 02:04:24,485
My hands are empty.

1625
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:25,736
They're not empty.

1626
02:04:33,661 --> 02:04:34,912
<i>I love it.</i>

1627
02:04:34,996 --> 02:04:36,622
<i>It's romantic.</i>

1628
02:04:36,706 --> 02:04:38,791
It's very moving.

1629
02:04:38,875 --> 02:04:40,293
That's very emotional.

1630
02:04:40,376 --> 02:04:43,129
-Well, thank you.
-We could call the chapter...

1631
02:04:44,714 --> 02:04:46,299
"Under the Umbrella."

1632
02:04:46,382 --> 02:04:47,842
-That's good.
-Perfect.

1633
02:04:47,925 --> 02:04:50,094
Now, there's the question of the contract.

1634
02:04:50,178 --> 02:04:52,513
I'm prepared to give you 5 percent of the royalties.

1635
02:04:52,597 --> 02:04:54,307
So I get 5 percent of the profit.

1636
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:57,685
Five percent of the net profits, after I recoup.

1637
02:04:58,269 --> 02:05:00,479
Well, what about a payment up front?

1638
02:05:00,563 --> 02:05:03,733
I'm the one taking the risk in printing this book.

1639
02:05:03,816 --> 02:05:05,526
Yes, but it's my book.

1640
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:07,695
And if it does well, we'll both make money.

1641
02:05:07,778 --> 02:05:09,614
If not, I can stay in business.

1642
02:05:09,697 --> 02:05:11,365
Oh, so I get nothing if it fails.

1643
02:05:11,449 --> 02:05:14,869
No, I'll give you $500 right now to buy out the copyright.

1644
02:05:15,328 --> 02:05:16,245
The copyright?

1645
02:05:16,329 --> 02:05:18,664
That's the right for reprinting, that sort of thing.

1646
02:05:18,748 --> 02:05:21,000
Sequels, characters for other stories.

1647
02:05:21,083 --> 02:05:24,712
-Might that be worth something?
-Well, only if it's a success.

1648
02:05:24,795 --> 02:05:28,174
I see. It seems like something I would want to own, no?

1649
02:05:28,257 --> 02:05:31,135
Didn't you say your family needed
the money more immediately?

1650
02:05:31,219 --> 02:05:33,679
Yes, they do, which is why I wanted up-front payment.

1651
02:05:33,763 --> 02:05:37,517
No. It's too risky. I'll only pay for the copyright.

1652
02:05:44,941 --> 02:05:47,819
You keep your $500, and I'll keep the copyright.

1653
02:05:49,612 --> 02:05:52,073
Also, I want 10 percent of royalties.

1654
02:05:53,908 --> 02:05:57,578
Five point five percent. That's very generous.

1655
02:05:57,662 --> 02:06:00,331
-Nine percent.
-Six percent, and that's it.

1656
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:07,296
Mr. Dashwood, if I'm going to sell my heroine
into marriage for money, I might as well get some of it.

1657
02:06:08,381 --> 02:06:10,091
Six point six percent.

1658
02:06:11,717 --> 02:06:12,593
Done.

1659
02:06:12,677 --> 02:06:15,263
And you don't need to decide about the copyright right now.

1660
02:06:15,346 --> 02:06:16,597
No, I've decided.

1661
02:06:16,681 --> 02:06:18,391
I want to own my own book.

1662
02:06:25,273 --> 02:06:27,817
-Where is she?
-She's here, everyone!

1663
02:06:33,865 --> 02:06:34,782
Come on!

1664
02:06:43,332 --> 02:06:46,043
Now, see if you can make a B.
